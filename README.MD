## Project Overview

This project fine-tunes the Mistral-7B language model using QLoRA on a corpus of historical diary-style text. 
The goal is to adapt the model’s generation style toward long-form, reflective diary entries while keeping training efficient using 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters.
