EVELYN'S DIARY


The two chief diarists of the age of Charles the Second are, _mutatis
mutandis_, not ill characterized by the remark of a wicked wit upon the
brothers Austin. "John Austin," it was said, "served God and died poor:
Charles Austin served the devil, and died rich. Both were clever fellows.
Charles was much the cleverer of the two." Thus John Evelyn and Samuel
Pepys, the former a perfect model of decorum, the latter a grievous
example of indecorum, have respectively left us diaries, of which the
indecorous is to the decorous as a zoölogical garden is to a museum:
while the disparity between the testamentary bequests of the two Austins
but imperfectly represents the reputation standing to Pepys's account
with posterity in comparison with that accruing to his sedate and
dignified contemporary.

Museums, nevertheless, have their uses, and Evelyn's comparatively jejune
record has laid us under no small obligation. But for Pepys's amazing
indiscretion and garrulity, qualities of which one cannot have too little
in life, or too much in the record of it, Evelyn would have been esteemed
the first diarist of his age. Unable for want of these qualifications to
draw any adequate picture of the stirring life around him, he has
executed at least one portrait admirably, his own. The likeness is,
moreover, valuable, as there is every reason to suppose it typical, and
representative of a very important class of society, the well-bred and
well-conducted section of the untitled aristocracy of England. We may
well believe that these men were not only the salt but the substance of
their order. There was an ill-bred section exclusively devoted to
festivity and sport. There was an ill-conducted section, plunged into the
dissipations of court life. But the majority were men like Evelyn: not,
perhaps, equally refined by culture and travel, or equally interested in
literary research and scientific experiment, but well informed and
polite; no strangers to the Court, yet hardly to be called courtiers,
and preferring country to town; loyal to Church and King but not
fanatical or rancorous; as yet but slightly imbued with the principles of
civil and religious liberty, yet adverse to carry the dogma of divine
right further than the right of succession; fortunate in having survived
all ideas of serfdom or vassalage, and in having few private interests
not fairly reconcilable with the general good. Evelyn was made to be the
spokesman of such a class, and, meaning to speak only for himself, he
delivers its mind concerning the Commonwealth and the Restoration, the
conduct of the later Stuart Kings and the Revolution.

Evelyn's Diary practically begins where many think he had no business to
be diarising, beyond the seas. The position of a loyalist who solaces
himself in Italy while his King is fighting for his crown certainly
requires explanation: it may be sufficient apology for Evelyn that
without the family estates he could be of no great service to the King,
and that these, lying near London, were actually in the grasp of the
Parliament. He was also but one of a large family and it was doubtless
convenient that one member should be out of harm's way. His three years'
absence (1643-6) has certainly proved advantageous to posterity. Evelyn
is, indeed, a mere sight-seer, but this renders his tour a precise record
of the objects which the sight-seer of the seventeenth century was
expected to note, and a mirror not only of the taste but of the feeling
of the time. There is no cult of anything, but there is curiosity about
everything; there is no perception of the sentiment of a landscape, but
real enjoyment of the landscape itself; antiquity is not unappreciated,
but modern works impart more real pleasure. Of the philosophical
reflections which afterward rose to the mind of Gibbon there is hardly a
vestige, and of course Evelyn is at an immeasurable distance from Byron
and De Staël. But he gives us exactly what we want, the actual attitude
of a cultivated young Englishman in presence of classic and renaissance
art with its background of Southern nature. We may register without undue
self-complacency a great development of the modern world in the
æsthetical region of the intellect, which implies many other kinds of
progress. It is interesting to compare with Evelyn's narrative the
chapters recording the visit to Italy supposed to have been made at this
very period by John Inglesant, who inevitably sees with the eyes of the
nineteenth century. Evelyn's casual remarks on foreign manners and
institutions display good sense, without extraordinary insight; in
description he is frequently observant and graphic, as in his account of
the galley slaves, and of Venetian female costumes. He naturally regards
Alpine scenery as "melancholy and troublesome."

Returned to England, Evelyn strictly follows the line of the average
English country gentleman, execrating the execution of Charles I.,
disgusted beyond measure with the suppression of the Church of England
service, but submissive to the powers that be until there are evident
indications of a change, which he promotes in anything but a Quixotic
spirit. Although he is sincerely attached to the monarchy, the condition
of the Church is evidently a matter of greater concern to him: Cromwell
would have done much to reconcile the royalists to his government, had it
been possible for him to have restored the liturgy and episcopacy. The
same lesson is to be derived from his demeanor during the reigns of
Charles and James. The exultation with which the Restoration is at first
hailed soon evaporates. The scandals of the Court are an offense,
notwithstanding Evelyn's personal attachment to the King. But the chief
point is not vice or favoritism or mismanagement, but alliances with
Roman Catholic powers against Protestant nations. Evelyn is enraged to
see Charles missing the part so clearly pointed out to him by Providence
as the protector of the Protestant religion all over Europe. The
conversion of the Duke of York is a fearful blow, James's ecclesiastical
policy after his accession adds to Evelyn's discontent day by day, while
political tyranny passes almost without remark. At last the old cavalier
is glad to welcome the Prince of Orange as deliverer, and though he has
no enthusiasm for William in his character as King, he remains his
dutiful subject. Just because Evelyn was by no means an extraordinary
person, he represents the plain straightforward sense of the English
gentry. The questions of the seventeenth century were far more religious
than political. The synthesis "Church and King" expressed the dearest
convictions of the great majority of English country families, but when
the two became incompatible they left no doubt which held the first place
in their hearts. They acted instinctively on the principle of the Persian
lady who preferred her brother to her husband. It was not impossible to
find a new King, but there was no alternative to the English Church.

Evelyn's memoirs thus possess a value far exceeding the modest measure of
worth allowed them by De Quincey: "They are useful as now and then
enabling one to fix the date of a particular event, but for little
besides." The Diary's direct contribution to historical accuracy is
insignificant; it is an index, not to chronological minutiæ, but to the
general progress of moral and political improvement. The editor of 1857
certainly goes too far in asserting that "All that might have been
excluded from the range of his opinions, his feelings and sympathies
embraced"; but it is interesting to observe the gradual widening of
Evelyn's sympathies with good men of all parties, and to find him in his
latter days criticising the evidence produced in support of the Popish
Plot on the one hand, and deploring the just condemnation of Algernon
Sydney on the other. It is true that, so far as the sufferings of his
country are concerned, his attitude is rather that of the Levite than of
the Samaritan; but more lively popular sympathies would have destroyed
the peculiar value attaching to the testimony of the reluctant witness.
We should, for example, have thought little of such a passage as the
following from the pen of Burnet, from Evelyn it is significant indeed:--

    _October 14, 1688._--The King's birthday. No guns from the Tower as
    usual. The sun eclipsed at its rising. This day signal for the
    victory of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel in
    Sussex. The wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this
    day. Wonderful expectation of the Dutch fleet. Public prayers
    ordered to be read in the churches against invasion.

It might be difficult to produce a nearer approximation in secular
literature to Daniel's "_Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin_."

There is little else in the Diary equally striking, though Evelyn's
description of Whitehall on the eve of the death of Charles the Second
ranks among the memorable passages of the language. It is nevertheless
full of interesting anecdotes and curious notices, especially of the
scientific research which, in default of any adequate public
organization, was in that age more efficaciously promoted by students
than by professors. De Quincey censures Evelyn for omitting to record the
conversation of the men with whom he associated, but he does not consider
that the Diary in its present shape is a digest of memoranda made long
previously, and that time failed at one period and memory at the other.
De Quincey, whose extreme acuteness was commonly evinced on the negative
side of a question, saw the weak points of the Diary upon its first
publication much more clearly than his contemporaries did, and was
betrayed into illiberality by resentment at what he thought its
undeserved vogue. Evelyn has in truth been fortunate; his record, which
his contemporaries would have neglected, appeared (1818) just in time to
be a precursor of the Anglican movement, a tendency evinced in a similar
fashion by the vindication, no doubt mistaken, of the Caroline authorship
of the "Icon Basilike." Evelyn was a welcome encounter to men of this
cast of thought, and was hailed as a model of piety, culture, and
urbanity, without sufficient consideration of his deficiencies as a
loyalist and a patriot. It also conduced to his reputation that all his
other writings should have virtually perished except his "Sylva," like
his Diary a landmark in the history of improvement, though in a widely
different department. But for his lack of diplomatic talent, he might be
compared with an eminent and much applauded, but in our times somewhat
decrescent, contemporary, Sir William Temple. Both these eminent persons
would have aroused a warmer feeling in posterity, and have effected more
for its instruction and entertainment, if they could occasionally have
dashed their dignity with an infusion of the grotesqueness, we will not
say of Pepys, but of Roger North. To them, however, their dignity was
their character, and although we could have wished them a larger measure
of geniality, we must feel indebted to them for their preservation of a
refined social type.

EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION


Evelyn lived in the busy and important times of King Charles I., Oliver
Cromwell, King Charles II., King James II., and King William, and early
accustomed himself to note such things as occurred, which he thought
worthy of remembrance. He was known to, and had much personal intercourse
with, the Kings Charles II. and James II.; and he was in habits of great
intimacy with many of the ministers of these two monarchs, and with many
of the eminent men of those days, as well among the clergy as the laity.
Foreigners distinguished for learning, or arts, who came to England, did
not leave it without visiting him.

The following pages contribute extensive and important particulars of
this eminent man. They show that he did not travel merely to count
steeples, as he expresses himself in one of his Letters: they develop his
private character as one of the most amiable kind. With a strong
predilection for monarchy, with a personal attachment to Kings Charles
II. and James II., formed when they resided at Paris, he was yet utterly
averse to the arbitrary measures of these monarchs.

Strongly and steadily attached to the doctrine and practice of the Church
of England, he yet felt the most liberal sentiments for those who
differed from him in opinion. He lived in intimacy with men of all
persuasions; nor did he think it necessary to break connection with
anyone who had ever been induced to desert the Church of England, and
embrace the doctrines of that of Rome. In writing to the brother of a
gentleman thus circumstanced, in 1659, he expresses himself in this
admirable manner: "For the rest, we must commit to Providence the success
of times and mitigation of proselytical fervors; having for my own
particular a very great charity for all who sincerely adore the Blessed
Jesus, our common and dear Saviour, as being full of hope that God
(however the present zeal of some, and the scandals taken by others at
the instant [present] affliction of the Church of England may transport
them) will at last compassionate our infirmities, clarify our judgments,
and make abatement for our ignorances, superstructures, passions, and
errors of corrupt times and interests, of which the Romish persuasion can
no way acquit herself, whatever the present prosperity and secular polity
may pretend. But God will make all things manifest in his own time, only
let us possess ourselves in patience and charity. This will cover a
multitude of imperfections."

He speaks with great moderation of the Roman Catholics in general,
admitting that some of the laws enacted against them might be mitigated;
but of the Jesuits he had the very worst opinion, considering them as a
most dangerous Society, and the principal authors of the misfortunes
which befell King James II., and of the horrible persecutions of the
Protestants in France and Savoy.

He must have conducted himself with uncommon prudence and address, for he
had personal friends in the Court of Cromwell, at the same time that he
was corresponding with his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, the
Ambassador of King Charles II. at Paris; and at the same period that he
paid his court to the King, he maintained his intimacy with a disgraced
minister.

In his travels, he made acquaintance not only with men eminent for
learning, but with men ingenious in every art and profession.

His manners we may presume to have been most agreeable; for his company
was sought by the greatest men, not merely by inviting him to their own
tables, but by their repeated visits to him at his own house; and this
was equally the case with regard to ladies, of many of whom he speaks in
the highest style of admiration, affection, and respect. He was master of
the French, Italian, and Spanish languages. That he had read a great deal
is manifest; but at what time he found opportunities for study, it is not
easy to say. He acknowledges himself to have been idle, while at Oxford;
and, when on his travels, he had little time for reading, except when he
stayed about nineteen weeks in France, and at Padua, where he was
likewise stationary for several months. At Rome, he remained a
considerable time, but, while there, he was so continually engaged in
viewing the great variety of interesting objects to be seen in that city,
that he could have found little leisure for reading. When resident in
England, he was so much occupied in the business of his numerous offices,
in paying visits, in receiving company at home, and in examining whatever
was deemed worthy of curiosity, or of scientific observation, that it is
astonishing how he found the opportunity to compose the numerous books
which he published, and the much greater number of Papers, on almost
every subject, which still remain in manuscript; to say nothing of the
very extensive and voluminous correspondence which he appears to have
carried on during his long life, with men of the greatest eminence in
Church and State, and the most distinguished for learning, both
Englishmen and foreigners. In this correspondence he does not seem to
have made use of an amanuensis; and he has left transcripts in his own
hand of great numbers of letters both received and sent. He observes,
indeed, in one of these, that he seldom went to bed before twelve, or
closed his eyes before one o'clock.

He was happy in a wife of congenial dispositions with his own, of an
enlightened mind, who had read much, and was skilled in etching and
painting, yet attentive to the domestic concerns of her household, and a
most affectionate mother.

His grandfather, George, was not the first of the family who settled in
Surrey. John, father of this George, was of Kingston, in 1520, and
married a daughter of David Vincent, Esq., Lord of the Manor of Long
Ditton, near Kingston, which afterward came in the hands of George, who
there carried on the manufacture of gunpowder. He purchased very
considerable estates in Surrey, and three of his sons became heads of
three families, viz, Thomas, his eldest son, at Long Ditton; John, at
Godstone, and Richard at Wotton. Each of these three families had the
title of Baronet conferred on them at different times, viz, at Godstone,
in 1660; Long Ditton, in 1683; and Wotton, in 1713.

The manufacture of gunpowder was carried on at Godstone as well as at
Long Ditton; but it does not appear that there ever was any mill at
Wotton, or that the purchase of that place was made with such a view.

It may be not altogether incurious to observe, that though Mr. Evelyn's
father was a man of very considerable fortune, the first rudiments of
this son's learning were acquired from the village schoolmaster over the
porch of Wotton Church. Of his progress at another school, and at
college, he himself speaks with great humility; nor did he add much to
his stock of knowledge, while he resided in the Middle Temple, to which
his father sent him, with the intention that he should apply to what he
calls "an impolished study," which he says he never liked.

The "Biographia" does not notice his tour in France, Flanders, and
Holland, in 1641, when he made a short campaign as a volunteer in an
English regiment then in service in Flanders.[1] Nor does it notice his
having set out, with intent to join King Charles I. at Brentford; and
subsequently desisting when the result of that battle became known, on
the ground that his brother's as well as his own estates were so near
London as to be fully in power of the Parliament, and that their
continued adherence would have been certain ruin to themselves without
any advantage to his Majesty. In this dangerous conjuncture he asked and
obtained the King's leave to travel. Of these travels, and the
observations he made therein, an ample account is given in this Diary.

    [Footnote 1: This expression is, perhaps, hardly applicable to the
    fact of Evelyn's having witnessed a siege merely as a curious
    spectator. He reached the camp on the 2d, and left it on the 8th of
    August, 1641. It is certain, however, that during these six days he
    took his turn on duty, and trailed a pike.--See Diary.]

The national troubles coming on before he had engaged in any settled plan
for his future life, it appears that he had thoughts of living in the
most private manner, and that, with his brother's permission, he had even
begun to prepare a place for retirement at Wotton. Nor did he afterward
wholly abandon his intention, if the plan of a college, which he sent to
Mr. Boyle in 1659, was really formed on a serious idea. This scheme is
given at length in the "Biographia," and in Dr. Hunter's edition of the
"Sylva" in 1776; but it may be observed that he proposes it should not be
more than twenty-five miles from London.

As to his answer to Sir George Mackenzie's panegyric on Solitude, in
which Mr. Evelyn takes the opposite part and urges the preference to
which public employment and an active life is entitled,--it may be
considered as the playful essay of one who, for the sake of argument,
would controvert another's position, though in reality agreeing with his
own opinion; if we think him serious in two letters to Mr. Abraham
Cowley, dated 12th March and 24th August, 1666, in the former of which he
writes: "You had reason to be astonished at the presumption, not to name
it affront, that I, who have so highly celebrated recess, and envied it
in others, should become an advocate for the enemy, which of all others
it abhors and flies from. I conjure you to believe that I am still of the
same mind, and that there is no person alive who does more honor and
breathe after the life and repose you so happily cultivate and advance by
your example; but, as those who praised dirt, a flea, and the gout, so
have I public employment in that trifling Essay, and that in so weak a
style compared with my antagonist's, as by that alone it will appear I
neither was nor could be serious, and I hope you believe I speak my very
soul to you.

    '_Sunt enim Musis sua ludicra mista Camoenis
    Otia sunt----_'"

In the other, he says, "I pronounce it to you from my heart as oft as I
consider it, that I look on your fruitions with inexpressible emulation,
and should think myself more happy than crowned heads, were I, as you,
the arbiter of mine own life, and could break from those gilded toys to
taste your well-described joys with such a wife and such a friend, whose
conversation exceeds all that the mistaken world calls happiness." But,
in truth, Mr. Evelyn's mind was too active to admit of solitude at all
times, however desirable it might appear to him in theory.

After he had settled at Deptford, which was in the time of Cromwell, he
kept up a constant correspondence with Sir Richard Browne (his
father-in-law), the King's Ambassador at Paris; and though his connection
must have been known, it does not appear that he met with any
interruption from the government here. Indeed, though he remained a
decided Royalist, he managed so well as to have intimate friends even
among those nearly connected with Cromwell; and to this we may attribute
his being able to avoid taking the Covenant, which he says he never did
take. In 1659, he published "An Apology for the Royal Party"; and soon
after printed a paper which was of great service to the King, entitled
"The Late News, or Message from Brussels Unmasked," which was an answer
to a pamphlet designed to represent the King in the worst light.

On the Restoration, we find him very frequently at Court; and he became
engaged in many public employments, still attending to his studies and
literary pursuits. Among these, is particularly to be mentioned the Royal
Society, in the establishment and conduct of which he took a very active
part. He procured Mr. Howard's library to be given to them; and by his
influence, in 1667, the Arundelian Marbles were obtained for the
University of Oxford.

His first appointment to a public office was in 1662, as a Commissioner
for reforming the buildings, ways, streets, and incumbrances, and
regulating hackney coaches in London. In the same year he sat as a
Commissioner on an inquiry into the conduct of the Lord Mayor, etc.,
concerning Sir Thomas Gresham's charities. In 1664 he was in a commission
for regulating the Mint; in the same year was appointed one of the
Commissioners for the care of the Sick and Wounded in the Dutch war; and
he was continued in the same employment in the second war with that
country.

He was one of the Commissioners for the repair of St. Paul's Cathedral,
shortly before it was burned in 1666. In that year he was also in a
commission for regulating the farming and making saltpetre; and in 1671
we find him a Commissioner of Plantations on the establishment of the
board, to which the Council of Trade was added in 1672.

In 1685 he was one of the Commissioners of the Privy Seal, during the
absence of the Earl of Clarendon (who held that office), on his going
Lord Lieutenant to Ireland. On the foundation of Greenwich Hospital, in
1695, he was one of the Commissioners; and, on the 30th of June, 1696,
laid the first stone of that building. He was also appointed Treasurer,
with a salary of £200 a year; but he says that it was a long time before
he received any part of it.

When the Czar of Muscovy came to England, in 1698, proposing to instruct
himself in the art of shipbuilding, he was desirous of having the use of
Sayes Court, in consequence of its vicinity to the King's dockyard at
Deptford. This was conceded; but during his stay he did so much damage
that Mr. Evelyn had an allowance of £150 for it. He especially regrets
the mischief done to his famous holly hedge, which might have been
thought beyond the reach of damage. But one of Czar Peter's favorite
recreations had been to demolish the hedges by riding through them in a
wheelbarrow.

October, 1699, his elder brother, George Evelyn, dying without male
issue, aged eighty-three, he succeeded to the paternal estate; and in May
following, he quitted Sayes Court and went to Wotton, where he passed the
remainder of his life, with the exception of occasional visits to London,
where he retained a house. In the great storm of 1703, he mentions in his
last edition of the "Sylva," above one thousand trees were blown down in
sight of his residence.

He died at his house in London, 27th February, 1705-6, in the
eighty-sixth year of his age, and was buried at Wotton. His lady survived
him nearly three years, dying 9th February, 1708-9, in her seventy-fourth
year, and was buried near him at Wotton.

Of Evelyn's children, a son, who died at the age of five, and a daughter,
who died at the age of nineteen, were almost prodigies. The particulars
of their extraordinary endowments, and the profound manner in which he
was affected at their deaths, may be seen in these volumes.

One daughter was well and happily settled; another less so; but she did
not survive her marriage more than a few months. The only son who lived
to the age of manhood, inherited his father's love of learning, and
distinguished himself by several publications.

Mr. Evelyn's employment as a Commissioner for the care of the Sick and
Wounded was very laborious; and, from the nature of it, must have been
extremely unpleasant. Almost the whole labor was in his department, which
included all the ports between the river Thames and Portsmouth; and he
had to travel in all seasons and weathers, by land and by water, in the
execution of his office, to which he gave the strictest attention. It
was rendered still more disagreeable by the great difficulty which he
found in procuring money for support of the prisoners. In the library at
Wotton, are copies of numerous letters to the Lord Treasurer and Officers
of State, representing, in the strongest terms, the great distress of the
poor men, and of those who had furnished lodging and necessaries for
them. At one time, there were such arrears of payment to the victuallers,
that, on landing additional sick and wounded, they lay some time in the
streets, the publicans refusing to receive them, and shutting up their
houses. After all this trouble and fatigue, he found as great difficulty
in getting his accounts settled.[2] In January, 1665-6, he formed a plan
for an Infirmary at Chatham, which he sent to Mr. Pepys, to be laid
before the Admiralty, with his reasons for recommending it; but it does
not appear that it was carried into execution.

    [Footnote 2: 2d October, 1665, he writes to the Lord Chancellor,
    Lord Arlington, Sir William Coventry, and Sir Philip Warwick,
    complaining of want of money for the prisoners: praying that while
    he and his brother Commissioners adventure their persons and all
    that is dear to them, in this uncomfortable service, they may not be
    exposed to ruin, and to a necessity of abandoning their care; and
    adding that they have lost their officers and servants by the
    pestilence, and are hourly environed with the saddest objects of
    perishing people. "I have," says he, "fifteen places full of sick
    men, where they put me to unspeakable trouble; the magistrates and
    justices, who should further us in our exigencies, hindering the
    people from giving us quarters, jealous of the contagion, and
    causing them to shut the doors at our approach."]

His employments, in connection with the repair of St. Paul's (which,
however, occupied him but a brief time), as in the Commission of Trade
and Plantations, and in the building of Greenwich Hospital, were much
better adapted to his inclinations and pursuits.

As a Commissioner of the Privy Seal in the reign of King James II., he
had a difficult task to perform. He was most steadily attached to the
Church of England, and the King required the Seal to be affixed to many
things incompatible with the welfare of that Church. This, on some
occasions, he refused to do, particularly to a license to Dr. Obadiah
Walker to print Popish books;[3] and on other occasions he absented
himself, leaving it to his brother Commissioners to act as they thought
fit. Such, however, was the King's estimation of him, that no displeasure
was evinced on this account.

    [Footnote 3: Dr. Walker had been a member of the Church of England,
    but had renounced it, and turned Papist.]

Of Evelyn's attempt to bring Colonel Morley (Cromwell's Lieutenant of the
Tower, immediately preceding the Restoration) over to the King's
interest, an imperfect account is given in the "Biographia." The fact is,
that there was great friendship between these gentlemen, and Evelyn did
endeavor to engage the Colonel in the King's interest. He saw him several
times, and put his life into his hands by writing to him on 12th January,
1659-60; he did not succeed, and Colonel Morley was too much his friend
to betray him; but so far from the Colonel having settled matters
privately with Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, or General Monk, as there
described, he was obliged, when the Restoration took place, actually to
apply to Evelyn to procure his pardon; who obtained it accordingly,
though, as he states, the Colonel was obliged to pay a large sum of money
for it. This could not have happened, if there had been any previous
negotiation with General Monk.

Dr. Campbell took some pains to vindicate Mr. Evelyn's book, entitled,
"Navigation and Commerce, their Origin and Progress," from the charge of
being an imperfect work, unequal to the expectation excited by the title.
But the Doctor, who had not the information which this Journal so amply
affords on this subject, was not aware that what was so printed was
nothing more than an Introduction to the History of the Dutch War; a work
undertaken by Evelyn at the express command of King Charles II., and the
materials for which were furnished by the Officers of State. The
completion of this work, after considerable progress had been made in it,
was put a stop to by the King himself, for what reason does not appear;
but perhaps it was found that Evelyn was inclined to tell too much of the
truth concerning a transaction, which it will be seen by his Journal that
he utterly reprobated. His copy of the History, as far as he had
proceeded, he put into the hands of his friend, Mr. Pepys, of the
Admiralty, who did not return it; but the books and manuscripts belonging
to Mr. Pepys passed into the possession of Magdalen College, Cambridge.

From the numerous authors who have spoken in high terms of Mr. Evelyn, we
will select the two following notices of him.

In the "Biographia Britannica" Dr. Campbell says, "It is certain that
very few authors who have written in our language deserve the character
of able and agreeable writers so well as Mr. Evelyn, who, though he was
acquainted with most sciences, and wrote upon many different subjects,
yet was very far, indeed the farthest of most men of his time, from being
a superficial writer. He had genius, he had taste, he had learning; and
he knew how to give all these a proper place in his works, so as never to
pass for a pedant, even with such as were least in love with literature,
and to be justly esteemed a polite author by those who knew it best."

Horace Walpole (afterward Earl of Orford), in his Catalogue of Engravers,
gives us the following admirably drawn character: "If Mr. Evelyn had not
been an artist himself, as I think I can prove he was, I should yet have
found it difficult to deny myself the pleasure of allotting him a place
among the arts he loved, promoted, patronized; and it would be but
justice to inscribe his name with due panegyric in these records, as I
have once or twice taken the liberty to criticise him. But they are
trifling blemishes compared with his amiable virtues and beneficence; and
it may be remarked that the worst I have said of him is, that he knew
more than he always communicated. It is no unwelcome satire to say, that
a man's intelligence and philosophy is inexhaustible. I mean not to write
his biography, but I must observe, that his life, which was extended to
eighty-six years, was a course of inquiry, study, curiosity, instruction,
and benevolence. The works of the Creator, and the minute labors of the
creature, were all objects of his pursuit. He unfolded the perfection of
the one, and assisted the imperfection of the other. He adored from
examination; was a courtier that flattered only by informing his Prince,
and by pointing out what was worthy of him to countenance; and really was
the neighbor of the Gospel, for there was no man that might not have been
the better for him. Whoever peruses a list of his works will subscribe to
my assertion. He was one of the first promoters of the Royal Society; a
patron of the ingenious and the indigent; and peculiarly serviceable to
the lettered world; for, besides his writings and discoveries, he
obtained the Arundelian Marbles for the University of Oxford, and the
Arundelian Library for the Royal Society. Nor is it the least part of his
praise, that he who proposed to Mr. Boyle the erection of a Philosophical
College for retired and speculative persons, had the honesty to write in
defense of active life against Sir George Mackenzie's 'Essay on
Solitude.' He knew that retirement, in his own hands, was industry and
benefit to mankind; but in those of others, laziness and inutility."

Evelyn was buried in the Dormitory adjoining Wotton Church.

On a white marble, covering a tomb shaped like a coffin, raised about
three feet above the floor, is inscribed:

                Here lies the Body
              of JOHN EVELYN, Esq.,
            of this place, second son
             of Richard Evelyn, Esq.;
          who having serv'd the Publick
      in several employments, of which that
     of Commissioner of the Privy-Seal in the
       Reign of King James the 2d was most
       honourable, and perpetuated his fame
        by far more lasting monuments than
       those of Stone or Brass, his learned
    and usefull Works, fell asleep the 27 day
      of February 1705-6, being the 86 year
      of his age, in full hope of a glorious
    Resurrection, thro' Faith in Jesus Christ.
        Living in an age of extraordinary
        Events and Revolutions, he learnt
        (as himself asserted) this Truth,
         which pursuant to his intention
                is here declared--
     _That all is vanity which is not honest,
        and that there is no solid wisdom
               but in real Piety._
         Of five Sons and three Daughters

           of Sir Rich. Browne of Sayes
           Court near Deptford in Kent,

             two others dying in the
             flower of their age, and
           all the Sons very young, except
                one named John, who
            deceased 24 March, 1698-9,
            in the 45 year of his age,
            leaving one son, John, and
             one daughter, Elizabeth.

DIARY OF JOHN EVELYN.


I was born at Wotton, in the County of Surrey, about twenty minutes past
two in the morning, being on Tuesday the 31st and last of October, 1620,
after my father had been married about seven years,[4] and that my mother
had borne him three children; viz, two daughters and one son, about the
33d year of his age, and the 23d of my mother's.

    [Footnote 4: He was married at St. Thomas's, Southwark, 27th
    January, 1613. My sister Eliza was born at nine at night, 28th
    November, 1614; Jane at four in the morning, 16th February, 1616; my
    brother George at nine at night, Wednesday, 18th June, 1617; and my
    brother Richard, 9th November, 1622.--_Note by Evelyn._]

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

My father, named Richard, was of a sanguine complexion, mixed with a dash
of choler: his hair inclining to light, which, though exceedingly thick,
became hoary by the time he had attained to thirty years of age; it was
somewhat curled toward the extremities; his beard, which he wore a little
peaked, as the mode was, of a brownish color, and so continued to the
last, save that it was somewhat mingled with gray hairs about his cheeks,
which, with his countenance, were clear and fresh-colored; his eyes
extraordinary quick and piercing; an ample forehead,--in sum, a very
well-composed visage and manly aspect: for the rest, he was but low of
stature, yet very strong. He was, for his life, so exact and temperate,
that I have heard he had never been surprised by excess, being ascetic
and sparing. His wisdom was great, and his judgment most acute; of solid
discourse, affable, humble, and in nothing affected; of a thriving, neat,
silent, and methodical genius, discreetly severe, yet liberal upon all
just occasions, both to his children, to strangers, and servants; a lover
of hospitality; and, in brief, of a singular and Christian moderation in
all his actions; not illiterate, nor obscure, as, having continued
Justice of the Peace and of the Quorum, he served his country as High
Sheriff, being, as I take it, the last dignified with that office for
Sussex and Surrey together, the same year, before their separation. He
was yet a studious decliner of honors and titles; being already in that
esteem with his country, that they could have added little to him besides
their burden. He was a person of that rare conversation that, upon
frequent recollection, and calling to mind passages of his life and
discourse, I could never charge him with the least passion, or
inadvertency. His estate was esteemed about £4000 per annum, well wooded,
and full of timber.

My mother's name was Eleanor, sole daughter and heiress of John
Standsfield, Esq., of an ancient and honorable family (though now
extinct) in Shropshire, by his wife Eleanor Comber, of a good and
well-known house in Sussex. She was of proper personage; of a brown
complexion; her eyes and hair of a lovely black; of constitution more
inclined to a religious melancholy, or pious sadness; of a rare memory,
and most exemplary life; for economy and prudence, esteemed one of the
most conspicuous in her country: which rendered her loss much deplored,
both by those who knew, and such as only heard of her.

Thus much, in brief, touching my parents; nor was it reasonable I should
speak less of them to whom I owe so much.

The place of my birth was Wotton, in the parish of Wotton, or Blackheath,
in the county of Surrey, the then mansion-house of my father, left him by
my grandfather, afterward and now my eldest brother's. It is situated in
the most southern part of the shire; and, though in a valley, yet really
upon part of Leith Hill, one of the most eminent in England for the
prodigious prospect to be seen from its summit, though by few observed.
From it may be discerned twelve or thirteen counties, with part of the
sea on the coast of Sussex, in a serene day. The house is large and
ancient, suitable to those hospitable times, and so sweetly environed
with those delicious streams and venerable woods, as in the judgment of
strangers as well as Englishmen it may be compared to one of the most
pleasant seats in the nation, and most tempting for a great person and a
wanton purse to render it conspicuous. It has rising grounds, meadows,
woods, and water, in abundance.

The distance from London little more than twenty miles, and yet so
securely placed, as if it were one hundred; three miles from Dorking,
which serves it abundantly with provision as well of land as sea; six
from Guildford, twelve from Kingston. I will say nothing of the air,
because the pre-eminence is universally given to Surrey, the soil being
dry and sandy; but I should speak much of the gardens, fountains, and
groves that adorn it, were they not as generally known to be among the
most natural, and (till this later and universal luxury of the whole
nation, since abounding in such expenses) the most magnificent that
England afforded; and which indeed gave one of the first examples to that
elegancy, since so much in vogue, and followed in the managing of their
waters, and other elegancies of that nature. Let me add, the contiguity
of five or six manors, the patronage of the livings about it, and what
Themistocles pronounced for none of the least advantages--the good
neighborhood. All which conspire here to render it an honorable and
handsome royalty, fit for the present possessor, my worthy brother, and
his noble lady, whose constant liberality gives them title both to the
place and the affections of all that know them. Thus, with the poet:

    _Nescio quâ natale solum dulcedine cunctos
    Ducit, et immemores non sinit esse sui._

I had given me the name of my grandfather, my mother's father, who,
together with a sister of Sir Thomas Evelyn, of Long Ditton, and Mr.
Comber, a near relation of my mother, were my susceptors. The solemnity
(yet upon what accident I know not, unless some indisposition in me) was
performed in the dining-room by Parson Higham, the present incumbent of
the parish, according to the forms prescribed by the then glorious Church
of England.

I was now (in regard to my mother's weakness, or rather custom of persons
of quality) put to nurse to one Peter, a neighbor's wife and tenant, of a
good, comely, brown, wholesome complexion, and in a most sweet place
toward the hills, flanked with wood and refreshed with streams; the
affection to which kind of solitude I sucked in with my very milk. It
appears, by a note of my father's, that I sucked till 17th of January,
1622, or at least I came not home before.[5]

    [Footnote 5: The whole of this passage, so characteristic of the
    writer's tastes and genius, and both the paragraphs before and after
    it, are printed for the first time in this edition. Portions of the
    preceding description of Wotton are also first taken from the
    original; and it may not be out of place to add that, more
    especially in the first fifty pages of this volume, a very large
    number of curious and interesting additions are made to Evelyn's
    text from the Manuscript of the Diary at Wotton.]

1623. The very first thing that I can call to memory, and from which time
forward I began to observe, was this year (1623) my youngest brother,
being in his nurse's arms, who, being then two days and nine months
younger than myself, was the last child of my dear parents.

1624. I was not initiated into any rudiments until near four years of
age, and then one Frier taught us at the church-porch of Wotton; and I do
perfectly remember the great talk and stir about Il Conde Gondomar, now
Ambassador from Spain (for near about this time was the match of our
Prince with the Infanta proposed); and the effects of that comet, 1618,
still working in the prodigious revolutions now beginning in Europe,
especially in Germany, whose sad commotions sprang from the Bohemians'
defection from the Emperor Matthias; upon which quarrel the Swedes broke
in, giving umbrage to the rest of the princes, and the whole Christian
world cause to deplore it, as never since enjoying perfect tranquillity.

1625. I was this year (being the first of the reign of King Charles) sent
by my father to Lewes, in Sussex, to be with my grandfather, Standsfield,
with whom I passed my childhood. This was the year in which the
pestilence was so epidemical, that there died in London 5,000 a week, and
I well remember the strict watches and examinations upon the ways as we
passed; and I was shortly after so dangerously sick of a fever that (as I
have heard) the physicians despaired of me.

1626. My picture was drawn in oil by one Chanterell, no ill painter.

1627. My grandfather, Standsfield, died this year, on the 5th of
February: I remember perfectly the solemnity at his funeral. He was
buried in the parish church of All Souls, where my grandmother, his
second wife, erected him a pious monument. About this time, was the
consecration of the Church of South Malling, near Lewes, by Dr. Field,
Bishop of Oxford (one Mr. Coxhall preached, who was afterward minister);
the building whereof was chiefly procured by my grandfather, who having
the impropriation, gave £20 a year out of it to this church. I afterward
sold the impropriation. I laid one of the first stones at the building of
the church.

1628-30. It was not till the year 1628, that I was put to learn my Latin
rudiments, and to write, of one Citolin, a Frenchman, in Lewes. I very
well remember that general muster previous to the Isle of Rhè's
expedition, and that I was one day awakened in the morning with the news
of the Duke of Buckingham being slain by that wretch, Felton, after our
disgrace before La Rochelle. And I now took so extraordinary a fancy to
drawing and designing, that I could never after wean my inclinations from
it, to the expense of much precious time, which might have been more
advantageously employed. I was now put to school to one Mr. Potts, in the
Cliff at Lewes, from whom, on the 7th of January, 1630, being the day
after Epiphany, I went to the free-school at Southover, near the town, of
which one Agnes Morley had been the foundress, and now Edward Snatt was
the master, under whom I remained till I was sent to the University.[6]
This year, my grandmother (with whom I sojourned) being married to one
Mr. Newton, a learned and most religious gentleman, we went from the
Cliff to dwell at his house in Southover. I do most perfectly remember
the jubilee which was universally expressed for the happy birth of the
Prince of Wales, 29th of May, now Charles II., our most gracious
Sovereign.

    [Footnote 6: Long afterward, Evelyn was in the habit of paying great
    respect to his old teacher.]

1631. There happened now an extraordinary dearth in England, corn bearing
an excessive price; and, in imitation of what I had seen my father do, I
began to observe matters more punctually, which I did use to set down in
a blank almanac. The Lord of Castlehaven's arraignment for many shameful
exorbitances was now all the talk, and the birth of the Princess Mary,
afterward Princess of Orange.

21st October, 1632. My eldest sister was married to Edward Darcy, Esq.,
who little deserved so excellent a person, a woman of so rare virtue. I
was not present at the nuptials; but I was soon afterward sent for into
Surrey, and my father would willingly have weaned me from my fondness of
my too indulgent grandmother, intending to have placed me at Eton; but,
not being so provident for my own benefit, and unreasonably terrified
with the report of the severe discipline there, I was sent back to Lewes;
which perverseness of mine I have since a thousand times deplored. This
was the first time that ever my parents had seen all their children
together in prosperity. While I was now trifling at home, I saw London,
where I lay one night only. The next day, I dined at Beddington, where I
was much delighted with the gardens and curiosities. Thence, we returned
to the Lady Darcy's, at Sutton; thence to Wotton; and, on the 16th of
August following, 1633, back to Lewes.

3d November, 1633. This year my father was appointed Sheriff, the last,
as I think, who served in that honorable office for Surrey and Sussex,
before they were disjoined. He had 116 servants in liveries, every one
liveried in green satin doublets; divers gentlemen and persons of quality
waited on him in the same garb and habit, which at that time (when thirty
or forty was the usual retinue of the High Sheriff) was esteemed a great
matter. Nor was this out of the least vanity that my father exceeded (who
was one of the greatest decliners of it); but because he could not refuse
the civility of his friends and relations, who voluntarily came
themselves, or sent in their servants. But my father was afterward most
unjustly and spitefully molested by that jeering judge, Richardson, for
reprieving the execution of a woman, to gratify my Lord of Lindsey, then
Admiral: but out of this he emerged with as much honor as trouble. The
king made this year his progress into Scotland, and Duke James was born.

15th December, 1634: My dear sister, Darcy, departed this life, being
arrived to her 20th year of age; in virtue advanced beyond her years, or
the merit of her husband, the worst of men. She had been brought to bed
the 2d of June before, but the infant died soon after her, the 24th of
December. I was therefore sent for home the second time, to celebrate the
obsequies of my sister; who was interred in a very honorable manner in
our dormitory joining to the parish church, where now her monument
stands.

1635. But my dear mother being now dangerously sick, I was, on the 3d of
September following, sent for to Wotton. Whom I found so far spent, that,
all human assistance failing, she in a most heavenly manner departed this
life upon the 29th of the same month, about eight in the evening of
Michaelmas-day. It was a malignant fever which took her away, about the
37th of her age, and 22d of her marriage, to our irreparable loss and the
regret of all that knew her. Certain it is, that the visible cause of her
indisposition proceeded from grief upon the loss of her daughter, and the
infant that followed it; and it is as certain, that when she perceived
the peril whereto its excess had engaged her, she strove to compose
herself and allay it; but it was too late, and she was forced to succumb.
Therefore summoning all her children then living (I shall never forget
it), she expressed herself in a manner so heavenly, with instructions so
pious and Christian, as made us strangely sensible of the extraordinary
loss then imminent; after which, embracing every one of us she gave to
each a ring with her blessing and dismissed us. Then, taking my father by
the hand, she recommended us to his care; and, because she was extremely
zealous for the education of my younger brother, she requested my father
that he might be sent with me to Lewes; and so having importuned him that
what he designed to bestow on her funeral, he would rather dispose among
the poor, she labored to compose herself for the blessed change which she
now expected. There was not a servant in the house whom she did not
expressly send for, advise, and infinitely affect with her counsel. Thus
she continued to employ her intervals, either instructing her relations,
or preparing of herself.

Though her physicians, Dr. Meverell, Dr. Clement, and Dr. Rand, had given
over all hopes of her recovery, and Sir Sanders Duncombe had tried his
celebrated and famous powder, yet she was many days impairing, and
endured the sharpest conflicts of her sickness with admirable patience
and most Christian resignation, retaining both her intellectuals and
ardent affections for her dissolution, to the very article of her
departure. When near her dissolution, she laid her hand on every one of
her children; and taking solemn leave of my father, with elevated heart
and eyes, she quietly expired, and resigned her soul to God. Thus ended
that prudent and pious woman, in the flower of her age, to the
inconsolable affliction of her husband, irreparable loss of her children,
and universal regret of all that knew her. She was interred, as near as
might be, to her daughter Darcy, the 3d of October, at night, but with no
mean ceremony.

It was the 3d of the ensuing November, after my brother George was gone
back to Oxford, ere I returned to Lewes, when I made way, according to
instructions received of my father, for my brother Richard, who was sent
the 12th after.

1636. This year being extremely dry, the pestilence much increased in
London, and divers parts of England.

13th February, 1637: I was especially admitted (and, as I remember, my
other brother) into the Middle Temple, London, though absent, and as yet
at school. There were now large contributions to the distressed
Palatinates.

The 10th of December my father sent a servant to bring us necessaries,
and the plague beginning now to cease, on the 3d of April, 1637, I left
school, where, till about the last year, I have been extremely remiss in
my studies; so as I went to the University rather out of shame of abiding
longer at school, than for any fitness, as by sad experience I found:
which put me to re-learn all that I had neglected, or but perfunctorily
gained.

[Sidenote: OXFORD]

10th May, 1637. I was admitted a Fellow-commoner of Baliol College,
Oxford; and, on the 29th, I was matriculated in the vestry of St. Mary's,
where I subscribed the Articles, and took the oaths: Dr. Baily, head of
St. John's, being vice-chancellor, afterward bishop. It appears by a
letter of my father's, that he was upon treaty with one Mr. Bathurst
(afterward Doctor and President), of Trinity College, who should have
been my tutor; but, lest my brother's tutor, Dr. Hobbs, more zealous in
his life than industrious to his pupils, should receive it as an affront,
and especially for that Fellow-commoners in Baliol were no more exempt
from exercise than the meanest scholars there, my father sent me thither
to one Mr. George Bradshaw (_nomen invisum!_ yet the son of an excellent
father, beneficed in Surrey). I ever thought my tutor had parts enough;
but as his ambition made him much suspected of the College, so his grudge
to Dr. Lawrence, the governor of it (whom he afterward supplanted), took
up so much of his time, that he seldom or never had the opportunity to
discharge his duty to his scholars. This I perceiving, associated myself
with one Mr. James Thicknesse (then a young man of the foundation,
afterward a Fellow of the house), by whose learned and friendly
conversation I received great advantage. At my first arrival, Dr.
Parkhurst was master: and after his decease, Dr. Lawrence, a chaplain of
his Majesty's and Margaret Professor, succeeded, an acute and learned
person; nor do I much reproach his severity, considering that the
extraordinary remissness of discipline had (till his coming) much
detracted from the reputation of that College.

There came in my time to the College one Nathaniel Conopios, out of
Greece, from Cyrill, the patriarch of Constantinople, who, returning many
years after, was made (as I understand) Bishop of Smyrna. He was the
first I ever saw drink coffee; which custom came not into England till
thirty years after.[7]

    [Footnote 7: Evelyn should have said "till twenty years after," not
    thirty. Coffee was introduced into England, and coffee-houses set
    up, in 1658.]

After I was somewhat settled there in my formalities (for then was the
University exceedingly regular, under the exact discipline of William
Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, then Chancellor), I added, as benefactor
to the library of the College, these books--"_ex dono Johannis Evelyni,
hujus Coll. Socio-Commensalis, filii Richardi Evelyni, è com. Surriæ,
armig^r_."--

"_Zanchii Opera_," vols. 1, 2, 3.

"_Granado in Thomam Aquinatem_," vols. 1, 2, 3.

"_Novarini Electa Sacra_" and "_Cresolii Anthologia Sacra_"; authors, it
seems, much desired by the students of divinity there.

Upon the 2d of July, being the first Sunday of the month, I first
received the blessed Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in the college
chapel, one Mr. Cooper, a Fellow of the house, preaching; and at this
time was the Church of England in her greatest splendor, all things
decent, and becoming the Peace, and the persons that governed. The most
of the following week I spent in visiting the Colleges, and several
rarities of the University, which do very much affect young comers.

18th July, 1637. I accompanied my eldest brother, who then quitted
Oxford, into the country; and, on the 9th of August, went to visit my
friends at Lewes, whence I returned the 12th to Wotton. On the 17th of
September, I received the blessed Sacrament at Wotton church, and 23d of
October went back to Oxford.

5th November, 1637. I received again the Holy Communion in our college
chapel, one Prouse, a Fellow (but a mad one), preaching.

9th December, 1637. I offered at my first exercise in the Hall, and
answered my opponent; and, upon the 11th following, declaimed in the
chapel before the Master, Fellows, and Scholars, according to the custom.
The 15th after, I first of all opposed in the Hall.

The Christmas ensuing, being at a Comedy which the gentlemen of Exeter
College presented to the University, and standing, for the better
advantage of seeing, upon a table in the Hall, which was near to another,
in the dark, being constrained by the extraordinary press to quit my
station, in leaping down to save myself I dashed my right leg with such
violence against the sharp edge of the other board, as gave me a hurt
which held me in cure till almost Easter, and confined me to my study.

22d January, 1638. I would needs be admitted into the dancing and
vaulting schools; of which late activity one Stokes, the master, did
afterward set forth a pretty book, which was published, with many witty
elogies before it.

4th February, 1638. One Mr. Wariner preached in our chapel; and, on the
25th, Mr. Wentworth, a kinsman of the Earl of Strafford; after which
followed the blessed Sacrament.

13th April, 1638. My father ordered that I should begin to manage my own
expenses, which till then my tutor had done; at which I was much
satisfied.

[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

9th July, 1638. I went home to visit my friends, and, on the 26th, with
my brother and sister to Lewes, where we abode till the 31st; and thence
to one Mr. Michael's, of Houghton, near Arundel, where we were very well
treated; and, on the 2d of August, to Portsmouth, and thence, having
surveyed the fortifications (a great rarity in that blessed halcyon time
in England), we passed into the Isle of Wight, to the house of my Lady
Richards, in a place called Yaverland; but were turned the following day
to Chichester, where, having viewed the city and fair cathedral, we
returned home.

About the beginning of September, I was so afflicted with a quartan ague,
that I could by no means get rid of it till the December following. This
was the fatal year wherein the rebellious Scots opposed the King, upon
the pretense of the introduction of some new ceremonies and the Book of
Common Prayer, and madly began our confusions, and their own destruction,
too, as it proved in event.

14th January, 1639. I came back to Oxford, after my tedious
indisposition, and to the infinite loss of my time; and now I began to
look upon the rudiments of music, in which I afterward arrived to some
formal knowledge, though to small perfection of hand, because I was so
frequently diverted with inclinations to newer trifles.

20th May, 1639. Accompanied with one Mr. J. Crafford (who afterward being
my fellow-traveler in Italy, there changed his religion), I took a
journey of pleasure to see the Somersetshire baths, Bristol, Cirencester,
Malmesbury, Abington, and divers other towns of lesser note; and returned
the 25th.

8th October, 1639. I went back to Oxford.

14th December, 1639. According to injunctions from the Heads of Colleges,
I went (among the rest) to the Confirmation at St. Mary's, where, after
sermon, the Bishop of Oxford laid his hands upon us, with the usual form
of benediction prescribed: but this received (I fear) for the more part
out of curiosity, rather than with that due preparation and advice which
had been requisite, could not be so effectual as otherwise that admirable
and useful institution might have been, and as I have since deplored it.

21st January, 1640. Came my brother, Richard, from school, to be my
chamber-fellow at the University. He was admitted the next day and
matriculated the 31st.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th April, 1640. I went to London to see the solemnity of his Majesty's
riding through the city in state to the Short Parliament, which began the
13th following,--a very glorious and magnificent sight, the King circled
with his royal diadem and the affections of his people: but the day after
I returned to Wotton again, where I stayed, my father's indisposition
suffering great intervals, till April 27th, when I was sent to London to
be first resident at the Middle Temple: so as my being at the University,
in regard of these avocations, was of very small benefit to me. Upon May
the 5th following, was the Parliament unhappily dissolved; and, on the
20th I returned with my brother George to Wotton, who, on the 28th of the
same month, was married at Albury to Mrs. Caldwell (an heiress of an
ancient Leicestershire family, where part of the nuptials were
celebrated).

10th June, 1640. I repaired with my brother to the term, to go into our
new lodgings (that were formerly in Essex-court), being a very handsome
apartment just over against the Hall-court, but four pair of stairs high,
which gave us the advantage of the fairer prospect; but did not much
contribute to the love of that impolished study, to which (I suppose) my
father had designed me, when he paid £145 to purchase our present lives,
and assignments afterward.

London, and especially the Court, were at this period in frequent
disorders, and great insolences were committed by the abused and too
happy City: in particular, the Bishop of Canterbury's Palace at Lambeth
was assaulted by a rude rabble from Southwark, my Lord Chamberlain
imprisoned and many scandalous libels and invectives scattered about the
streets, to the reproach of Government, and the fermentation of our since
distractions: so that, upon the 25th of June, I was sent for to Wotton,
and the 27th after, my father's indisposition augmenting, by advice of
the physicians he repaired to the Bath.

7th July, 1640. My brother George and I, understanding the peril my
father was in upon a sudden attack of his infirmity, rode post from
Guildford toward him, and found him extraordinary weak; yet so as that,
continuing his course, he held out till the 8th of September, when I
returned home with him in his litter.

15th October, 1640. I went to the Temple, it being Michaelmas Term.

30th December, 1640. I saw his Majesty (coming from his Northern
Expedition) ride in pomp and a kind of ovation, with all the marks of a
happy peace, restored to the affections of his people, being conducted
through London with a most splendid cavalcade; and on the 3d of November
following (a day never to be mentioned without a curse), to that long
ungrateful, foolish, and fatal Parliament, the beginning of all our
sorrows for twenty years after, and the period of the most happy monarch
in the world: _Quis talia fando!_

But my father being by this time entered into a dropsy, an indisposition
the most unsuspected, being a person so exemplarily temperate, and of
admirable regimen, hastened me back to Wotton, December the 12th; where,
the 24th following, between twelve and one o'clock at noon, departed this
life that excellent man and indulgent parent, retaining his senses and
piety to the last, which he most tenderly expressed in blessing us, whom
he now left to the world and the worst of times, while he was taken from
the evil to come.

1641. It was a sad and lugubrious beginning of the year, when on the 2d
of January, 1640-1, we at night followed the mourning hearse to the
church at Wotton; when, after a sermon and funeral oration by the
minister, my father was interred near his formerly erected monument, and
mingled with the ashes of our mother, his dear wife. Thus we were bereft
of both our parents in a period when we most of all stood in need of
their counsel and assistance, especially myself, of a raw, vain,
uncertain, and very unwary inclination: but so it pleased God to make
trial of my conduct in a conjuncture of the greatest and most prodigious
hazard that ever the youth of England saw; and, if I did not amidst all
this impeach my liberty nor my virtue with the rest who made shipwreck of
both, it was more the infinite goodness and mercy of God than the least
providence or discretion of mine own, who now thought of nothing but the
pursuit of vanity, and the confused imaginations of young men.

15th April, 1641. I repaired to London to hear and see the famous trial
of the Earl of Strafford, Lord-Deputy of Ireland, who, on the 22d of
March, had been summoned before both Houses of Parliament, and now
appeared in Westminster-hall,[8] which was prepared with scaffolds for
the Lords and Commons, who, together with the King, Queen, Prince, and
flower of the noblesse, were spectators and auditors of the greatest
malice and the greatest innocency that ever met before so illustrous an
assembly. It was Thomas, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of
England, who was made High Steward upon this occasion; and the sequel is
too well known to need any notice of the event.

    [Footnote 8: On the 15th of April Strafford made his eloquent
    defense, which it seems to have been Evelyn's good fortune to be
    present at. And here the reader may remark the fact, not without
    significance, that between the entries on this page of the Diary
    which relate to Lord Strafford, the young Prince of Orange came over
    to make love to the Princess Royal, then twelve years old; and that
    the marriage was subsequently celebrated amid extraordinary Court
    rejoicings and festivities, in which the King took a prominent part,
    during the short interval which elapsed between the sentence and
    execution of the King's great and unfortunate minister.]

On the 27th of April, came over out of Holland the young Prince of
Orange, with a splendid equipage, to make love to his Majesty's eldest
daughter, the now Princess Royal.

That evening, was celebrated the pompous funeral of the Duke of Richmond,
who was carried in effigy, with all the ensigns of that illustrious
family, in an open chariot, in great solemnity, through London to
Westminster Abbey.

On the 12th of May, I beheld on Tower-hill the fatal stroke which severed
the wisest head in England from the shoulders of the Earl of Strafford,
whose crime coming under the cognizance of no human law or statute, a new
one was made, not to be a precedent, but his destruction. With what
reluctancy the King signed the execution, he has sufficiently expressed;
to which he imputes his own unjust suffering--to such exorbitancy were
things arrived.

On the 24th of May, I returned to Wotton; and, on the 28th of June, I
went to London with my sister, Jane, and the day after sat to one
Vanderborcht for my picture in oil, at Arundel-house, whose servant that
excellent painter was, brought out of Germany when the Earl returned from
Vienna (whither he was sent Ambassador-extraordinary, with great pomp and
charge, though without any effect, through the artifice of the Jesuited
Spaniard who governed all in that conjuncture). With Vanderborcht, the
painter, he brought over Winceslaus Hollar, the sculptor, who engraved
not only the unhappy Deputy's trial in Westminster-hall, but his
decapitation; as he did several other historical things, then relating to
the accidents happening during the Rebellion in England, with great
skill; besides many cities, towns, and landscapes, not only of this
nation, but of foreign parts, and divers portraits of famous persons then
in being; and things designed from the best pieces of the rare paintings
and masters of which the Earl of Arundel was possessor, purchased and
collected in his travels with incredible expense: so as, though Hollar's
were but etched in aquafortis, I account the collection to be the most
authentic and useful extant. Hollar was the son of a gentleman near
Prague, in Bohemia, and my very good friend, perverted at last by the
Jesuits at Antwerp to change his religion; a very honest, simple,
well-meaning man, who at last came over again into England, where he
died. We have the whole history of the king's reign, from his trial in
Westminster-hall and before, to the restoration of King Charles II.,
represented in several sculptures, with that also of Archbishop Laud, by
this indefatigable artist; besides innumerable sculptures in the works of
Dugdale, Ashmole, and other historical and useful works. I am the more
particular upon this for the fruit of that collection, which I wish I had
entire.

This picture[9] I presented to my sister, being at her request, on my
resolution to absent myself from this ill face of things at home, which
gave umbrage to wiser than myself that the medal was reversing, and our
calamities but yet in their infancy: so that, on the 15th of July, having
procured a pass at the Custom-house, where I repeated my oath of
allegiance, I went from London to Gravesend, accompanied with one Mr.
Caryll, a Surrey gentleman, and our servants, where we arrived by six
o'clock that evening, with a purpose to take the first opportunity of a
passage for Holland. But the wind as yet not favorable, we had time to
view the Block-house of that town, which answered to another over against
it at Tilbury, famous for the rendezvous of Queen Elizabeth, in the year
1588, which we found stored with twenty pieces of cannon, and other
ammunition proportionable. On the 19th of July, we made a short excursion
to Rochester, and having seen the cathedral went to Chatham to see the
Royal Sovereign, a glorious vessel of burden lately built there, being
for defense and ornament, the richest that ever spread cloth before the
wind. She carried an hundred brass cannon, and was 1,200 tons; a rare
sailer, the work of the famous Phineas Pett, inventor of the
frigate-fashion of building, to this day practiced. But what is to be
deplored as to this vessel is, that it cost his Majesty the affections of
his subjects, perverted by the malcontent of great ones, who took
occasion to quarrel for his having raised a very slight tax for the
building of this, and equipping the rest of the navy, without an act of
Parliament; though, by the suffrages of the major part of the Judges the
King might legally do in times of imminent danger, of which his Majesty
was best apprised. But this not satisfying a jealous party, it was
condemned as unprecedented, and not justifiable as to the Royal
prerogative; and, accordingly, the Judges were removed out of their
places, fined, and imprisoned.[10]

    [Footnote 9: His own portrait.]

    [Footnote 10: In such manner Evelyn refers to the tax of Ship-money.
    But compare this remarkable passage, now first printed from the
    original, with the tone in which, eight years later, he spoke of the
    only chance by which monarchy in England might be saved; namely,
    that of "doing nothing as to government but what shall be approved
    by the old way of a free parliament, and the known laws of the
    land."]

We returned again this evening, and on the 21st of July embarked in a
Dutch frigate, bound for Flushing, convoyed and accompanied by five other
stout vessels, whereof one was a man-of-war. The next day at noon, we
landed at Flushing.

[Sidenote: DE VERE]

Being desirous to overtake the Leagure,[11] which was then before Genep,
ere the summer should be too far spent, we went this evening from
Flushing to Middleburg, another fine town in this island, to De Vere,
whence the most ancient and illustrious Earls of Oxford derive their
family, who have spent so much blood in assisting the state during their
wars. From De Vere we passed over many towns, houses, and ruins of
demolished suburbs, etc., which have formerly been swallowed up by the
sea; at what time no less than eight of those islands had been
irrecoverably lost.

    [Footnote 11: The meaning of this expression is, that they should be
    in time to witness the siege.]

The next day we arrived at Dort, the first town of Holland, furnished
with all German commodities, and especially Rhenish wines and timber. It
hath almost at the extremity a very spacious and venerable church; a
stately senate house, wherein was holden that famous synod against the
Arminians in 1618; and in that hall hangeth a picture of "The Passion,"
an exceeding rare and much-esteemed piece.

From Dort, being desirous to hasten toward the army, I took wagon this
afternoon to Rotterdam, whither we were hurried in less than an hour,
though it be ten miles distant; so furiously do those Foremen drive. I
went first to visit the great church, the Doole, the Bourse, and the
public statue of the learned Erasmus, of brass. They showed us his house,
or rather the mean cottage, wherein he was born, over which there are
extant these lines, in capital letters:

    ÆDIBUS HIS ORTUS, MUNDUM DECORAVIT ERASMUS
       ARTIBUS INGENIO, RELIGIONE, FIDE.

The 26th of July I passed by a straight and commodious river through
Delft to the Hague; in which journey I observed divers leprous poor
creatures dwelling in solitary huts on the brink of the water, and
permitted to ask the charity of passengers, which is conveyed to them in
a floating box that they cast out.

Arrived at the Hague, I went first to the Queen of Bohemia's court, where
I had the honor to kiss her Majesty's hand, and several of the
Princesses', her daughters. Prince Maurice was also there, newly come out
of Germany; and my Lord Finch, not long before fled out of England from
the fury of the Parliament. It was a fasting day with the Queen for the
unfortunate death of her husband, and the presence chamber had been hung
with black velvet ever since his decease.

[Sidenote: NIMEGUEN]

The 28th of July I went to Leyden; and the 29th to Utrecht, being thirty
English miles distant (as they reckon by hours). It was now Kermas, or a
fair, in this town, the streets swarming with boors and rudeness, so
that early the next morning, having visited the ancient Bishop's court,
and the two famous churches, I satisfied my curiosity till my return, and
better leisure. We then came to Rynen, where the Queen of Bohemia hath a
neat and well built palace, or country house, after the Italian manner,
as I remember; and so, crossing the Rhine, upon which this villa is
situated, lodged that night in a countryman's house. The 31st to
Nimeguen; and on the 2d of August we arrived at the Leagure, where was
then the whole army encamped about Genep, a very strong castle situated
on the river Waal; but, being taken four or five days before, we had only
a sight of the demolitions. The next Sunday was the thanksgiving sermons
performed in Colonel Goring's regiment (eldest son of the since Earl of
Norwich) by Mr. Goffe, his chaplain (now turned Roman, and
father-confessor to the Queen-mother). The evening was spent in firing
cannon and other expressions of military triumphs.

Now, according to the compliment, I was received a volunteer in the
company of Captain Apsley, of whose Captain-lieutenant, Honywood (Apsley
being absent), I received many civilities.

The 3d of August, at night, we rode about the lines of circumvallation,
the general being then in the field. The next day I was accommodated with
a very spacious and commodious tent for my lodging; as before I was with
a horse, which I had at command, and a hut which during the excessive
heats was a great convenience; for the sun piercing the canvas of the
tent, it was during the day unsufferable, and at night not seldom
infested with mists and fogs, which ascended from the river.

6th August, 1641. As the turn came about, we were ordered to watch on a
horn-work near our quarters, and trail a pike, being the next morning
relieved by a company of French. This was our continual duty till the
castle was refortified, and all danger of quitting that station secured;
whence I went to see a Convent of Franciscan Friars, not far from our
quarters, where we found both the chapel and refectory full, crowded with
the goods of such poor people as at the approach of the army had fled
with them thither for sanctuary. On the day following, I went to view all
the trenches, approaches, and mines, etc. of the besiegers; and, in
particular, I took special notice of the wheel-bridge, which engine his
Excellency had made to run over the moat when they stormed the castle; as
it is since described (with all the other particulars of this siege) by
the author of that incomparable work, "Hollandia Illustrata." The walls
and ramparts of earth, which a mine had broken and crumbled, were of
prodigious thickness.

Upon the 8th of August, I dined in the horse-quarters with Sir Robert
Stone and his lady, Sir William Stradling, and divers Cavaliers; where
there was very good cheer, but hot service for a young drinker, as then I
was; so that, being pretty well satisfied with the confusion of armies
and sieges (if such that of the United Provinces may be called, where
their quarters and encampments are so admirably regular, and orders so
exactly observed, as few cities, the best governed in time of peace,
exceed it for all conveniences), I took my leave of the Leagure and
Camerades; and, on the 12th of August, I embarked on the "Waal," in
company with three grave divines, who entertained us a great part of our
passage with a long dispute concerning the lawfulness of church-music. We
now sailed by Teil, where we landed some of our freight; and about five
o'clock we touched at a pretty town named Bommell, that had divers
English in garrison. It stands upon Contribution-land, which subjects the
environs to the Spanish incursions. We sailed also by an exceeding strong
fort called Lovestein, famous for the escape of the learned Hugo Grotius,
who, being in durance as a capital offender, as was the unhappy
Barneveldt, by the stratagem of his lady, was conveyed in a trunk
supposed to be filled with books only. We lay at Gorcum, a very strong
and considerable frontier.

13th August, 1641. We arrived late at Rotterdam, where was their annual
mart or fair, so furnished with pictures (especially landscapes and
drolleries, as they call those clownish representations), that I was
amazed. Some of these I bought and sent into England. The reason of this
store of pictures, and their cheapness, proceeds from their want of land
to employ their stock, so that it is an ordinary thing to find a common
farmer lay out two or three thousand pounds in this commodity. Their
houses are full of them, and they vend them at their fairs to very great
gains. Here I first saw an elephant, who was extremely well disciplined
and obedient. It was a beast of a monstrous size, yet as flexible and
nimble in the joints, contrary to the vulgar tradition, as could be
imagined from so prodigious a bulk and strange fabric; but I most of all
admired the dexterity and strength of its proboscis, on which it was able
to support two or three men, and by which it took and reached whatever
was offered to it; its teeth were but short, being a female, and not old.
I was also shown a pelican, or _onocratulas_ of Pliny, with its large
gullets, in which he kept his reserve of fish; the plumage was white,
legs red, flat, and film-footed, likewise a cock with four legs, two
rumps and vents: also a hen which had two large spurs growing out of her
sides, penetrating the feathers of her wings.

17th August, 1641. I passed again through Delft, and visited the church
in which was the monument of Prince William of Nassau,--the first of the
Williams, and savior (as they call him) of their liberty, which cost him
his life by a vile assassination. It is a piece of rare art, consisting
of several figures, as big as the life, in copper. There is in the same
place a magnificent tomb of his son and successor, Maurice. The
senate-house hath a very stately portico, supported with choice columns
of black marble, as I remember, of one entire stone. Within, there hangs
a weighty vessel of wood, not unlike a butter-churn, which the
adventurous woman that hath two husbands at one time is to wear on her
shoulders, her head peeping out at the top only, and so led about the
town, as a penance for her incontinence. From hence, we went the next day
to Ryswick, a stately country-house of the Prince of Orange, for nothing
more remarkable than the delicious walks planted with lime trees, and the
modern paintings within.

[Sidenote: HAGUE]

[Sidenote: AMSTERDAM]

19th August, 1641. We returned to the Hague, and went to visit the Hoff,
or Prince's Court, with the adjoining gardens full of ornament, close
walks, statues, marbles, grots, fountains, and artificial music. There is
to this palace a stately hall, not much inferior to ours of Westminster,
hung round with colors and other trophies taken from the Spaniards;[12]
and the sides below are furnished with shops. Next day (the 20th) I
returned to Delft, thence to Rotterdam, the Hague, and Leyden, where
immediately I mounted a wagon, which that night, late as it was, brought
us to Haerlem. About seven in the morning after I came to Amsterdam,
where being provided with a lodging, the first thing I went to see was a
Synagogue of the Jews (being Saturday), whose ceremonies, ornaments,
lamps, law, and schools, afforded matter for my contemplation. The women
were secluded from the men, being seated in galleries above, shut with
lattices, having their heads muffled with linen, after a fantastical and
somewhat extraordinary fashion; the men, wearing a large calico mantle,
yellow colored, over their hats, all the while waving their bodies, while
at their devotions. From thence, I went to a place without the town,
called Overkirk, where they have a spacious field assigned them to bury
their dead, full of sepulchers with Hebraic inscriptions, some of them
stately and costly. Looking through one of these monuments, where the
stones were disjointed, I perceived divers books and papers lie about a
corpse; for it seems, when any learned Rabbi dies, they bury some of his
books with him. With the help of a stick, I raked out several, written in
Hebrew characters, but much impaired. As we returned, we stepped in to
see the Spin-house, a kind of bridewell, where incorrigible and lewd
women are kept in discipline and labor, but all neat. We were shown an
hospital for poor travelers and pilgrims, built by Queen Elizabeth of
England; and another maintained by the city.

    [Footnote 12: Westminster hall used to be so in Term time, and
    during the sitting of Parliament, as late as the beginning of the
    reign of George III.]

The State or Senate-house of this town, if the design be perfected, will
be one of the most costly and magnificent pieces of architecture in
Europe, especially for the materials and the carvings. In the Doole is
painted, on a very large table, the bust of Marie de Medicis, supported
by four royal diadems, the work of one Vanderdall, who hath set his name
thereon, 1st September, 1638.

On Sunday, I heard an English sermon at the Presbyterian congregation,
where they had chalked upon a slate the psalms that were to be sung, so
that all the congregation might see them without the bidding of a clerk.
I was told, that after such an age no minister was permitted to preach,
but had his maintenance continued during life.

I purposely changed my lodgings, being desirous to converse with the
sectaries that swarmed in this city, out of whose spawn came those almost
innumerable broods in England afterward. It was at a Brownist's house,
where we had an extraordinary good table. There was in pension with us my
Lord Keeper, Finch, and one Sir J. Fotherbee. Here I also found an
English Carmelite, who was going through Germany with an Irish gentleman.
I now went to see the Weese-house, a foundation like our Charter-house,
for the education of decayed persons, orphans, and poor children, where
they are taught several occupations. The girls are so well brought up to
housewifery, that men of good worth, who seek that chiefly in a woman,
frequently take their wives from this hospital. Thence to the Rasp-house,
where the lusty knaves are compelled to work; and the rasping of brasil
and logwood for the dyers is very hard labor. To the Dool-house, for
madmen and fools. But none did I so much admire, as an Hospital for their
lame and decrepit soldiers and seamen, where the accommodations are very
great, the building answerable; and, indeed, for the like public
charities the provisions are admirable in this country, where, as no idle
vagabonds are suffered (as in England they are), there is hardly a child
of four or five years old, but they find some employment for it.

It was on a Sunday morning that I went to the Bourse, or Exchange, after
their sermons were ended, to see the Dog-market, which lasts till two in
the afternoon, in this place of convention of merchants from all parts of
the world. The building is not comparable to that of London, built by
that worthy citizen, Sir Thomas Gresham, yet in one respect exceeding it,
that vessels of considerable burden ride at the very quay contiguous to
it; and indeed it is by extraordinary industry that as well this city, as
generally all the towns of Holland, are so accommodated with graffs,
cuts, sluices, moles, and rivers, made by hand, that nothing is more
frequent than to see a whole navy, belonging to this mercantile people,
riding at anchor before their very doors: and yet their streets even,
straight, and well paved, the houses so uniform and planted with lime
trees, as nothing can be more beautiful.

The next day we were entertained at a kind of tavern, called the
Briloft, appertaining to a rich Anabaptist, where, in the upper rooms of
the house, were divers pretty waterworks, rising 108 feet from the
ground. Here were many quaint devices, fountains, artificial music,
noises of beasts, and chirping of birds; but what pleased me most was a
large pendant candlestick, branching into several sockets, furnished all
with ordinary candles to appearance, out of the wicks spouting out
streams of water, instead of flames. This seemed then and was a rarity,
before the philosophy of compressed air made it intelligible. There was
likewise a cylinder that entertained the company with a variety of
chimes, the hammers striking upon the brims of porcelain dishes, suited
to the tones and notes, without cracking any of them. Many other
waterworks were shown.

The Kaiser's or Emperor's Graft, which is an ample and long street,
appearing like a city in a forest; the lime trees planted just before
each house, and at the margin of that goodly aqueduct so curiously
wharfed with Klincard brick, which likewise paves the streets, than which
nothing can be more useful and neat. This part of Amsterdam is built and
gained upon the main sea, supported by piles at an immense charge, and
fitted for the most busy concourse of traffickers and people of commerce
beyond any place, or mart, in the world. Nor must I forget the port of
entrance into an issue of this town, composed of very magnificent pieces
of architecture, some of the ancient and best manner, as are divers
churches.

The turrets, or steeples, are adorned after a particular manner and
invention; the chimes of bells are so rarely managed, that being curious
to know whether the motion was from any engine, I went up to that of St.
Nicholas, where I found one who played all sorts of compositions from the
tablature before him, as if he had fingered an organ; for so were the
hammers fastened with wires to several keys put into a frame twenty feet
below the bells, upon which (by the help of a wooden instrument, not much
unlike a weaver's shuttle, that guarded his hand) he struck on the keys
and played to admiration. All this while, through the clattering of the
wires, din of the too nearly sounding bells, and noise that his wooden
gloves made, the confusion was so great, that it was impossible for the
musician, or any that stood near him, to hear anything at all; yet, to
those at a distance, and especially in the streets, the harmony and the
time were the most exact and agreeable.

The south church is richly paved with black and white marble,--the west
is a new fabric; and generally all the churches in Holland are furnished
with organs, lamps, and monuments, carefully preserved from the fury and
impiety of popular reformers, whose zeal has foolishly transported them
in other places rather to act like madmen than religious.

[Sidenote: HAERLEM]

Upon St. Bartholomew's day, I went among the booksellers, and visited the
famous Hondius and Bleaw's shop, to buy some maps, atlases, and other
works of that kind. At another shop, I furnished myself with some shells
and Indian curiosities; and so, toward the end of August, I returned
again to Haerlem by the river, ten miles in length, straight as a line,
and of competent breadth for ships to sail by one another. They showed us
a cottage where, they told us, dwelt a woman who had been married to her
twenty-fifth husband, and being now a widow, was prohibited to marry in
future; yet it could not be proved that she had ever made away with any
of her husbands, though the suspicion had brought her divers times to
trouble.

Haerlem is a very delicate town and hath one of the fairest churches of
the Gothic design I had ever seen. There hang in the steeple, which is
very high, two silver bells, said to have been brought from Damietta, in
Egypt, by an earl of Holland, in memory of whose success they are rung
out every evening. In the nave hang the goodliest branches of brass for
tapers that I have seen, esteemed of great value for the curiosity of the
workmanship; also a fair pair of organs, which I could not find they made
use of in divine service, or so much as to assist them in singing psalms,
but only for show, and to recreate the people before and after their
devotions, while the burgomasters were walking and conferring about their
affairs. Near the west window hang two models of ships, completely
equipped, in memory of that invention of saws under their keels, with
which they cut through the chain of booms, which barred the port of
Damietta. Having visited this church, the fish-market, and made some
inquiry about the printing-house, the invention whereof is said to have
been in this town, I returned to Leyden.

[Sidenote: LEYDEN]

At Leyden, I was carried up to the castle, or Pyrgus, built on a very
steep artificial mount, cast up (as reported) by Hengist the Saxon, on
his return out of England, as a place to retire to, in case of any sudden
inundations.

The churches are many and fair; in one of them lies buried the learned
and illustrious Joseph Scaliger, without any extraordinary inscription,
who, having left the world a monument of his worth more lasting than
marble, needed nothing more than his own name; which I think is all
engraven on his sepulcher. He left his library to this University.

28th August, 1641. I went to see the college and schools, which are
nothing extraordinary, and was complimented with a _matricula_ by the
_magnificus_ Professor, who first in Latin demanded of me where my
lodging in the town was, my name, age, birth, and to what Faculty I
addicted myself; then, recording my answers in a book, he administered an
oath to me that I should observe the statutes and orders of the
University while I stayed, and then delivered me a ticket, by virtue
whereof I was made excise-free; for all which worthy privileges, and the
pains of writing, he accepted of a rix-dollar.

Here was now the famous Dan. Heinsius, whom I so longed to see, as well
as the no less famous printer, Elzevir's printing-house and shop,
renowned for the politeness of the character and editions of what he has
published through Europe. Hence to the physic-garden, well stored with
exotic plants, if the catalogue presented to me by the gardener be a
faithful register.

But, among all the rarities of this place, I was much pleased with a
sight of their anatomy-school, theater, and repository adjoining, which
is well furnished with natural curiosities; skeletons, from the whale and
elephant to the fly and spider; which last is a very delicate piece of
art, to see how the bones (if I may so call them of so tender an insect)
could be separated from the mucilaginous parts of that minute animal.
Among a great variety of other things, I was shown the knife newly taken
out of a drunken Dutchman's guts, by an incision in his side, after it
had slipped from his fingers into his stomach. The pictures of the
chirurgeon and his patient, both living, were there.

There is without the town a fair Mall, curiously planted.

Returning to my lodging, I was showed the statue, cut in stone, of the
happy monk, whom they report to have been the first inventor of
typography, set over the door; but this is much controverted by others,
who strive for the glory of it, besides John Gutenberg.

I was brought acquainted with a Burgundian Jew, who had married an
apostate Kentish woman. I asked him divers questions: he told me, among
other things, that the World should never end; that our souls
transmigrated, and that even those of the most holy persons did penance
in the bodies of brutes after death,--and so he interpreted the
banishment and savage life of Nebuchadnezzar: that all the Jews should
rise again, and be led to Jerusalem; that the Romans only were the
occasion of our Savior's death, whom he affirmed (as the Turks do) to be
a great prophet, but not the Messiah. He showed me several books of their
devotion, which he had translated into English, for the instruction of
his wife; he told me that when the Messiah came, all the ships, barks,
and vessels of Holland should, by the power of certain strange
whirlwinds, be loosed from their anchors, and transported in a moment to
all the desolate ports and havens throughout the world, wherever the
dispersion was, to convey their brethren and tribes to the Holy City;
with other such like stuff. He was a merry drunken fellow, but would by
no means handle any money (for something I purchased of him), it being
Saturday; but desired me to leave it in the window, meaning to receive it
on Sunday morning.

1st September, 1641. I went to Delft and Rotterdam, and two days after
back to the Hague, to bespeak a suit of horseman's armor, which I caused
to be made to fit me. I now rode out of town to see the monument of the
woman, pretended to have been a countess of Holland, reported to have had
as many children at one birth, as there are days in the year. The basins
were hung up in which they were baptized, together with a large
description of the matter-of-fact in a frame of carved work, in the
church of Lysdun, a desolate place. As I returned, I diverted to see one
of the Prince's Palaces, called the Hoff Van Hounsler's Dyck, a very fair
cloistered and quadrangular building. The gallery is prettily painted
with several huntings, and at one end a gordian knot, with rustical
instruments so artificially represented, as to deceive an accurate eye to
distinguish it from actual relievo. The ceiling of the staircase is
painted with the "Rape of Ganymede," and other pendant figures, the work
of F. Covenberg, of whose hand I bought an excellent drollery, which I
afterward parted with to my brother George of Wotton, where it now hangs.
To this palace join a fair garden and park, curiously planted with limes.

8th September, 1641. Returned to Rotterdam, through Delftshaven and
Sedan, where were at that time Colonel Goring's winter quarters. This
town has heretofore been very much talked of for witches.

10th September, 1641. I took a wagon for Dort, to be present at the
reception of the Queen-mother, Marie de Medicis, Dowager of France, widow
of Henry the Great, and mother to the French King, Louis XIII., and the
Queen of England, whence she newly arrived, tossed to and fro by the
various fortune of her life. From this city, she designed for Cologne,
conducted by the Earl of Arundel and the Herr Van Bredrod. At this
interview, I saw the Princess of Orange, and the lady her daughter,
afterward married to the House of Brandenburgh. There was little
remarkable in this reception befitting the greatness of her person; but
an universal discontent, which accompanied that unlucky woman wherever
she went.

12th September, 1641. I went toward Bois-le-Duc, where we arrived on the
16th, at the time when the new citadel was advancing, with innumerable
hands, and incomparable inventions for draining off the waters out of the
fens and morasses about it, being by buckets, mills, cochleas, pumps, and
the like; in which the Hollanders are the most expert in Europe. Here
were now sixteen companies and nine troops of horse. They were also
cutting a new river, to pass from the town to a castle not far from it.
Here we split our skiff, falling foul upon another through negligence of
the master, who was fain to run aground, to our no little hazard. At our
arrival, a soldier conveyed us to the Governor, where our names were
taken, and our persons examined very strictly.

17th September, 1641. I was permitted to walk the round and view the
works, and to visit a convent of religious women of the order of St.
Clara (who by the capitulation were allowed to enjoy their monastery and
maintenance undisturbed, at the surrender of the town twelve years
since), where we had a collation and very civil entertainment. They had a
neat chapel, in which the heart of the Duke of Cleves, their founder,
lies inhumed under a plate of brass. Within the cloister is a garden, and
in the middle of it an overgrown lime tree, out of whose stem, near the
root, issue five upright and exceeding tall suckers, or bolls, the like
whereof for evenness and height I had not observed.

The chief church of this city is curiously carved within and without,
furnished with a pair of organs, and a most magnificent font of copper.

18th September, 1641. I went to see that most impregnable town and fort
of Hysdune, where I was exceedingly obliged to one Colonel Crombe, the
lieutenant-governor, who would needs make me accept the honor of being
captain of the watch, and to give the word this night. The fortification
is very irregular, but esteemed one of the most considerable for strength
and situation in the Netherlands. We departed toward Gorcum. Here Sir
Kenelm Digby, traveling toward Cologne, met us.

The next morning, the 19th, we arrived at Dort, passing by the Decoys,
where they catch innumerable quantities of fowl.

[Sidenote: ROTTERDAM]

22d September, 1641. I went again to Rotterdam to receive a pass which I
expected from Brussels, securing me through Brabant and Flanders,
designing to go into England through those countries. The Cardinal
Infante, brother to the King of Spain, was then governor. By this pass,
having obtained another from the Prince of Orange, upon the 24th of
September I departed through Dort; but met with very bad tempestuous
weather, being several times driven back, and obliged to lie at anchor
off Keele, other vessels lying there waiting better weather. The 25th and
26th we made other essays; but were again repulsed to the harbor, where
lay sixty vessels waiting to sail. But, on the 27th, we, impatient of the
time and inhospitableness of the place, sailed again with a contrary and
impetuous wind and a terrible sea, in great jeopardy; for we had much
ado to keep ourselves above water, the billows breaking desperately on
our vessel: we were driven into Williamstadt, a place garrisoned by the
English, where the governor had a fair house. The works, and especially
the counterscarp, are curiously hedged with quick, and planted with a
stately row of limes on the rampart. The church is of a round structure,
with a cupola, and the town belongs entirely to the Prince of Orange, as
does that of Breda, and some other places.

28th September, 1641. Failing of an appointment, I was constrained to
return to Dort for a bill of exchange; but it was the 1st of October ere
I could get back. At Keele, I numbered 141 vessels, who durst not yet
venture out; but, animated by the master of a stout bark, after a small
encounter of weather, we arrived by four that evening at Steenbergen. In
the passage we sailed over a sea called the Plaats, an exceeding
dangerous water, by reason of two contrary tides which meet there very
impetuously. Here, because of the many shelves, we were forced to tide it
along the Channel; but, ere we could gain the place, the ebb was so far
spent, that we were compelled to foot it at least two long miles, through
a most pelting shower of rain.

2d October, 1641. With a gentleman of the Rhyngraves, I went in a cart,
or tumbrel (for it was no better; no other accommodation could be
procured), of two wheels and one horse, to Bergen-op-Zoom, meeting by the
way divers parties of his Highness's army now retiring toward their
winter quarters; the convoy skiffs riding by thousands along the harbor.
The fort was heretofore built by the English.

The next morning I embarked for Lillo, having refused a convoy of horse
which was offered me. The tide being against us, we landed short of the
fort on the beach, where we marched half leg deep in mud, ere we could
gain the dyke, which, being five or six miles from Lillo, we were forced
to walk on foot very wet and discomposed; and then entering a boat we
passed the ferry, and came to the castle. Being taken before the
Governor, he demanded my pass, to which he set his hand, and asked two
rix-dollars for a fee, which methought appeared very exorbitant in a
soldier of his quality. I told him that I had already purchased my pass
of the commissaries at Rotterdam; at which, in a great fury, snatching
the paper out of my hand, he flung it scornfully under the table, and
bade me try whether I could get to Antwerp without his permission: but I
had no sooner given him the dollars, then he returned the passport
surlily enough, and made me pay fourteen Dutch shillings to the cantone,
or searcher, for my contempt, which I was glad to do for fear of further
trouble, should he have discovered my Spanish pass, in which the States
were therein treated by the name of rebels. Besides all these exactions,
I gave the commissary six shillings, to the soldiers something, and, ere
perfectly clear of this frontier, thirty-one stivers to the man-of-war,
who lay blocking up the river between Lillo and the opposite sconce
called Lifkinshoeck.

[Sidenote: ANTWERP]

4th October, 1641. We sailed by several Spanish forts, out of one of
which, St. Mary's port, came a Don on board us, to whom I showed my
Spanish pass, which he signed, and civilly dismissed us. Hence, sailing
by another man-of-war, to which we lowered our topsails, we at length
arrived at Antwerp.

The lodgings here are very handsome and convenient. I lost little time;
but, with the aid of one Mr. Lewkner, our conductor, we visited divers
churches, colleges, and monasteries. The Church of the Jesuits is most
sumptuous and magnificent; a glorious fabric without and within, wholly
incrusted with marble, inlaid and polished into divers representations of
histories, landscapes, and flowers. On the high altar is placed the
statue of the Blessed Virgin and our Savior in white marble, with a boss
in the girdle set with very fair and rich sapphires, and divers other
stones of price. The choir is a glorious piece of architecture: the
pulpit supported by four angels, and adorned with other carvings, and
rare pictures by Rubens, now lately dead, and divers votive tables and
relics. Hence, to the Vroù Kirk, or Nôtre Dame of Antwerp: it is a very
venerable fabric, built after the Gothic manner, especially the tower,
which I ascended, the better to take a view of the country adjacent;
which, happening on a day when the sun shone exceedingly bright, and
darted his rays without any interruption, afforded so bright a reflection
to us who were above, and had a full prospect of both land and water
about it, that I was much confirmed in my opinion of the moon's being of
some such substance as this earthly globe: perceiving all the subjacent
country, at so small an horizontal distance, to repercuss such a light as
I could hardly look against, save where the river, and other large water
within our view, appeared of a more dark and uniform color; resembling
those spots in the moon supposed to be seas there, according to Hevelius,
and as they appear in our late telescopes. I numbered in this church
thirty privileged altars, that of St. Sebastian adorned with a painting
of his martyrdom.

We went to see the Jerusalem Church, affirmed to have been founded by one
who, upon divers great wagers, passed to and fro between that city and
Antwerp, on foot, by which he procured large sums of money, which he
bestowed on this pious structure.[13] Hence, to St. Mary's Chapel, where
I had some conference with two English Jesuits, confessors to Colonel
Jaye's regiment. These fathers conducted us to the Cloister of Nuns,
where we heard a Dutch sermon upon the exposure of the Host. The
Senate-house of this city is a very spacious and magnificent building.

    [Footnote 13: This notice, slipped by accident into the entries
    which refer to Antwerp, belongs to those of Bruges.]

5th October, 1641. I visited the Jesuits' School, which, for the fame of
their method, I greatly desired to see. They were divided into four
classes, with several inscriptions over each: as, first, _Ad majorem Dei
gloriam_; over the second, _Princeps diligentiæ_; the third, _Imperator
Byzantiorum_; over the fourth and uppermost, _Imperator Romanorum_. Under
these, the scholars and pupils and their places, or forms with titles and
priority according to their proficiency. Their dormitory and lodgings
above were exceedingly neat. They have a prison for the offenders and
less diligent; and, in an ample court, to recreate themselves in, is an
aviary, and a yard, where eagles, vultures, foxes, monkeys, and other
animals are kept, to divert the boys withal at their hours of remission.
To this school join the music and mathematical schools, and lastly a
pretty, neat chapel. The great street is built after the Italian mode, in
the middle whereof is erected a glorious crucifix of white and black
marble, greater than the life. This is a very fair and noble street,
clean, well paved, and sweet to admiration.

The Oesters house, belonging to the East India Company, is a stately
palace, adorned with more than 300 windows. From hence, walking into the
Gun-garden, I was allowed to see as much of the citadel as is permitted
to strangers. It is a matchless piece of modern fortification,
accommodated with lodgments for the soldiers and magazines. The graffs,
ramparts, and platforms are stupendous. Returning by the shop of
Plantine, I bought some books, for the namesake only of that famous
printer.

But there was nothing about this city which more ravished me than those
delicious shades and walks of stately trees, which render the fortified
works of the town one of the sweetest places in Europe; nor did I ever
observe a more quiet, clean, elegantly built and civil place, than this
magnificent and famous city of Antwerp. In the evening, I was invited to
Signor Duerte's, a Portuguese by nation, an exceeding rich merchant,
whose palace I found to be furnished like a prince's. His three daughters
entertained us with rare music, vocal and instrumental, which was
finished with a handsome collation. I took leave of the ladies and of
sweet Antwerp, as late as it was, embarking for Brussels on the Scheldt
in a vessel, which delivered us to a second boat (in another river) drawn
or towed by horses. In this passage, we frequently changed our barge, by
reason of the bridges thwarting our course. Here I observed numerous
families inhabiting their vessels and floating dwellings, so built and
divided by cabins, as few houses on land enjoyed better accommodation;
stored with all sorts of utensils, neat chambers, a pretty parlor, and
kept so sweet, that nothing could be more refreshing. The rivers on which
they are drawn are very clear and still waters, and pass through a most
pleasant country on both the banks. We had in our boat a very good
ordinary, and excellent company. The cut is straight as a line for twenty
English miles. What I much admired was, near the midway, another
artificial river, which intersects this at right angles, but on an
eminence of ground, and is carried in an aqueduct of stone so far above
the other as that the waters neither mingle, nor hinder one another's
passage.

We came to a town called Villefrow, where all the passengers went on
shore to wash at a fountain issuing out of a pillar, and then came
aboard again. On the margin of this long tract are abundance of shrines
and images, defended from the injuries of the weather by niches of stone
wherein they are placed.

[Sidenote: BRUSSELS]

7th October, 1641. We arrived at Brussels at nine in the morning. The
Stadt-house, near the market place, is, for the carving in freestone, a
most laborious and finished piece, well worthy observation. The
flesh-shambles are also built of stone. I was pleased with certain small
engines, by which a girl, or boy, was able to draw up, or let down, great
bridges, which in divers parts of this city crossed the channel for the
benefit of passengers. The walls of this town are very entire, and full
of towers at competent distances. The cathedral is built upon a very high
and exceeding steep ascent, to which we mounted by fair steps of stone.
Hence I walked to a convent of English Nuns, with whom I sat discoursing
most part of the afternoon.

8th October, 1641. Being the morning I came away, I went to see the
Prince's Court, an ancient, confused building, not much unlike the Hofft,
at the Hague: there is here likewise a very large hall, where they vend
all sorts of wares. Through this we passed by the chapel, which is indeed
rarely arched, and in the middle of it was the hearse, or catafalque, of
the late Archduchess, the wise and pious Clara Eugenia. Out of this we
were conducted to the lodgings, tapestried with incomparable arras, and
adorned with many excellent pieces of Rubens, old and young Breugel,
Titian, and Stenwick, with stories of most of the late actions in the
Netherlands.

By an accident we could not see the library. There is a fair terrace
which looks to the vineyard, in which, on pedestals, are fixed the
statues of all the Spanish kings of the house of Austria. The opposite
walls are painted by Rubens, being an history of the late tumults in
Belgia: in the last piece, the Archduchess shuts a great pair of gates
upon Mars, who is coming out of hell, armed, and in a menacing posture;
which, with that other of the Infanta taking leave of Don Philip IV., is
a most incomparable table.

From hence, we walked into the park, which for being entirely within the
walls of the city is particularly remarkable: nor is it less pleasant
than if in the most solitary recesses; so naturally is it furnished with
whatever may render it agreeable, melancholy, and country-like. Here is a
stately heronry, divers springs of water, artificial cascades, rocks,
grots; one whereof is composed of the extravagant roots of trees,
cunningly built and hung together with wires. In this park are both
fallow and red deer.

From hence, we were led into the Menage, and out of that into a most
sweet and delicious garden, where was another grot of more neat and
costly materials, full of noble statues, and entertaining us with
artificial music; but the hedge of water, in form of lattice-work, which
the fountaineer caused to ascend out of the earth by degrees, exceedingly
pleased and surprised me; for thus, with a pervious wall, or rather a
palisade hedge of water, was the whole parterre environed.

There is likewise a fair aviary; and in the court next it are kept divers
sorts of animals, rare and exotic fowl, as eagles, cranes, storks,
bustards, pheasants of several kinds, and a duck having four wings. In
another division of the same close are rabbits of an almost perfect
yellow color.

There was no Court now in the palace; the Infante Cardinal, who was the
Governor of Flanders, being dead but newly, and every one in deep
mourning.

At near eleven o'clock, I repaired to his Majesty's agent, Sir Henry de
Vic, who very courteously received me, and accommodated me with a coach
and six horses, which carried me from Brussels to Ghent, where it was to
meet my Lord of Arundel, Earl Marshal of England, who had requested me
when I was at Antwerp to send it for him, if I went not thither myself.

Thus taking leave of Brussels and a sad Court, yet full of gallant
persons (for in this small city, the acquaintance being universal, ladies
and gentlemen, I perceived had great diversions, and frequent meetings),
I hastened toward Ghent. On the way, I met with divers little wagons,
prettily contrived, and full of peddling merchandise, drawn by mastiff
dogs, harnessed completely like so many coach horses; in some four, in
others six, as in Brussels itself I had observed. In Antwerp I saw, as I
remember, four dogs draw five lusty children in a chariot: the master
commands them whither he pleases, crying his wares about the streets.
After passing through Ouse, by six in the evening, I arrived at Ghent.
This is a city of so great a circumference, that it is reported to be
seven leagues round; but there is not half of it now built, much of it
remaining in fields and desolate pastures even within the walls, which
have strong gates toward the west, and two fair churches.

Here I beheld the palace wherein John of Gaunt and Charles V. were born;
whose statue[14] stands in the market-place, upon a high pillar, with his
sword drawn, to which (as I was told) the magistrates and burghers were
wont to repair upon a certain day every year with ropes about their
necks, in token of submission and penance for an old rebellion of theirs;
but now the hemp is changed into a blue ribbon. Here is planted the
basilisco, or great gun, so much talked of. The Lys and the Scheldt
meeting in this vast city, divide it into twenty-six islands, which are
united by many bridges, somewhat resembling Venice. This night I supped
with the Abbot of Andoyne, a pleasant and courteous priest.

    [Footnote 14: That of Charles V.]

8th October, 1641. I passed by a boat to Bruges, taking in at a redoubt a
convoy of fourteen musketeers, because the other side of the river, being
Contribution-land, was subject to the inroads and depredations of the
bordering States. This river was cut by the famous Marquis Spinola, and
is in my judgment a wonderful piece of labor, and a worthy public work,
being in some places forced through the main rock, to an incredible
depth, for thirty miles. At the end of each mile is built a small
redoubt, which communicates a line to the next, and so the whole way,
from whence we received many volleys of shot, in compliment to my Lord
Marshal, who was in our vessel, a passenger with us. At five that
evening, we were met by the magistrates of Bruges, who came out to convey
my Lord to his lodgings, at whose cost he was entertained that night.

The morning after we went to see the Stadt-house and adjoining aqueduct,
the church, and market-place, where we saw cheeses and butter piled up in
heaps; also the fortifications and graffs, which are extremely large.

The 9th, we arrived at Ostend by a straight and artificial river. Here,
with leave of the captain of the watch, I was carried to survey the
river and harbor, with fortifications on one side thereof: the east and
south are mud and earth walls. It is a very strong place, and lately
stood a memorable siege three years, three months, three weeks, and three
days. I went to see the church of St. Peter, and the cloisters of the
Franciscans.

10th October, 1641. I went by wagon, accompanied with a jovial
commissary, to Dunkirk, the journey being made all on the sea sands. On
our arrival, we first viewed the court of guards, the works, the
townhouse, and the new church; the latter is very beautiful within; and
another, wherein they showed us an excellent piece of "Our Savior's
Bearing the Cross." The harbor, in two channels, coming up to the town,
was choked with a multitude of prizes.

From hence, the next day, I marched three English miles toward the packet
boat, being a pretty frigate of six guns, which embarked us for England
about three in the afternoon.

[Sidenote: DOVER]

At our going off, the fort, against which our pinnace anchored saluted my
Lord Marshal with twelve great guns, which we answered with three. Not
having the wind favorable, we anchored that night before Calais. About
midnight, we weighed; and, at four in the morning, though not far from
Dover, we could not make the pier till four that afternoon, the wind
proving contrary and driving us westward: but at last we got on shore,
October the 12th.

From Dover, I that night rode post to Canterbury. Here I visited the
cathedral, then in great splendor; those famous windows being entire,
since demolished by the fanatics. The next morning by Sittingbourne, I
came to Rochester, and thence to Gravesend, where a light-horseman (as
they call it) taking us in, we spent our tide as far as Greenwich. From
hence, after we had a little refreshed ourselves at the College (for by
reason of contagion then in London we balked the inns), we came to
London, landing at Arundel stairs. Here I took leave of his Lordship, and
retired to my lodgings in the Middle Temple, being about two in the
morning, the 14th of October.

16th October, 1641. I went to see my brother at Wotton. On the 31st of
that month (unfortunate for the Irish Rebellion, which broke out on the
23d), I was one and twenty years of age.

7th November, 1641. After receiving the Sacrament at Wotton church, I
visited my Lord Marshal at Albury.

23d November, 1641. I returned to London; and, on the 25th, saw his
Majesty ride through the City after his coming out of Scotland, and a
Peace proclaimed, with great acclamations and joy of the giddy people.

15th December, 1641. I was elected one of the Comptrollers of the Middle
Temple revellers, as the fashion of the young students and gentlemen was,
the Christmas being kept this year with great solemnity; but, being
desirous to pass it in the country, I got leave to resign my staff of
office, and went with my brother Richard to Wotton.

10th January, 1642. I gave a visit to my cousin Hatton, of Ditton.

19th January, 1642. I went to London, where I stayed till 5th of March,
studying a little, but dancing and fooling more.

3d October, 1642. To Chichester, and hence the next day to see the siege
of Portsmouth; for now was that bloody difference between the King and
Parliament broken out, which ended in the fatal tragedy so many years
after. It was on the day of its being rendered to Sir William Waller;
which gave me an opportunity of taking my leave of Colonel Goring, the
governor, now embarking for France. This day was fought that signal
battle at Edgehill. Thence I went to Southampton and Winchester, where I
visited the castle, school, church, and King Arthur's Round Table; but
especially the church, and its Saxon kings' monuments, which I esteemed a
worthy antiquity.

The 12th of November was the battle of Brentford, surprisingly fought;
and to the great consternation of the City, had his Majesty (as it was
believed he would) pursued his advantage. I came in with my horse and
arms just at the retreat; but was not permitted to stay longer than the
15th, by reason of the army marching to Gloucester; which would have left
both me and my brothers exposed to ruin, without any advantage to his
Majesty.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th December, 1642. I went from Wotton to London, to see the so much
celebrated line of communication, and on the 10th returned to Wotton,
nobody knowing of my having been in his Majesty's army.

10th March, 1643. I went to Hartingford-berry to visit my cousin,
Keightly.

11th March, 1643. I went to see my Lord of Salisbury's Palace at
Hatfield, where the most considerable rarity, besides the house (inferior
to few then in England for its architecture), were the garden and
vineyard, rarely well watered and planted. They also showed us the
picture of Secretary Cecil, in Mosaic work, very well done by some
Italian hand.

I must not forget what amazed us exceedingly in the night before, namely,
a shining cloud in the air, in shape resembling a sword, the point
reaching to the north; it was as bright as the moon, the rest of the sky
being very serene. It began about eleven at night, and vanished not till
above one, being seen by all the south of England. I made many journeys
to and from London.

15th April, 1643. To Hatfield, and near the town of Hertford I went to
see Sir J. Harrison's house new built. Returning to London, I called to
see his Majesty's house and gardens at Theobald's, since demolished by
the rebels.

2d May, 1643. I went from Wotton to London, where I saw the furious and
zealous people demolish that stately Cross in Cheapside.

On the 4th I returned, with no little regret, for the confusion that
threatened us. Resolving to possess myself in some quiet, if it might be,
in a time of so great jealousy, I built by my brother's permission, a
study, made a fish-pond, an island, and some other solitudes and
retirements at Wotton; which gave the first occasion of improving them to
those waterworks and gardens which afterward succeeded them, and became
at that time the most famous of England.

12th July, 1643. I sent my black menage horse and furniture with a friend
to his Majesty, then at Oxford.

23d July, 1643. The Covenant being pressed, I absented myself; but,
finding it impossible to evade the doing very unhandsome things, and
which had been a great cause of my perpetual motions hitherto between
Wotton and London, October the 2d, I obtained a license of his Majesty,
dated at Oxford and signed by the King, to travel again.

6th November, 1643. Lying by the way from Wotton at Sir Ralph
Whitfield's, at Blechingley (whither both my brothers had conducted me),
I arrived at London on the 7th, and two days after took boat at the
Tower-wharf, which carried me as far as Sittingbourne, though not without
danger, I being only in a pair of oars, exposed to a hideous storm: but
it pleased God that we got in before the peril was considerable. From
thence, I went by post to Dover, accompanied with one Mr. Thicknesse, a
very dear friend of mine.

11th November, 1643. Having a reasonable good passage, though the weather
was snowy and untoward enough, we came before Calais, where, as we went
on shore, mistaking the tide, our shallop struck on the sands, with no
little danger; but at length we got off.

Calais is considered an extraordinary well-fortified place, in the old
castle and new citadel regarding the sea. The haven consists of a long
bank of sand, lying opposite to it. The market place and the church are
remarkable things, besides those relics of our former dominion there. I
remember there were engraven in stone, upon the front of an ancient
dwelling which was showed us, these words in English--"God save the
King," together with the name of the architect and date. The walls of the
town are substantial; but the situation toward the land is not pleasant,
by reason of the marshes and low grounds about it.

12th November, 1643. After dinner we took horse with the Messagere,
hoping to have arrived at Boulogne that night; but there fell so great a
snow, accompanied with hail, rain, and sudden darkness, that we had much
ado to gain the next village; and in this passage, being to cross a
valley by a causeway, and a bridge built over a small river, the rain
that had fallen making it an impetuous stream for near a quarter of a
mile, my horse slipping had almost been the occasion of my perishing. We
none of us went to bed; for the soldiers in those parts leaving little in
the villages, we had enough to do to get ourselves dry, by morning,
between the fire and the fresh straw. The next day early, we arrived at
Boulogne.

This is a double town, one part of it situate on a high rock, or downs;
the other, called the lower town, is yet with a great declivity toward
the sea; both of them defended by a strong castle, which stands on a
notable eminence. Under the town runs the river, which is yet but an
inconsiderable brook. Henry VIII., in the siege of this place is said to
have used those great leathern guns which I have since beheld in the
Tower of London, inscribed, "_Non Marte opus est cui non deficit
Mercurius_"; if at least the history be true, which my Lord Herbert
doubts.

The next morning, in some danger of parties [Spanish] surprising us, we
came to Montreuil, built on the summit of a most conspicuous hill,
environed with fair and ample meadows; but all the suburbs had been from
time to time ruined, and were now lately burnt by the Spanish inroads.
This town is fortified with two very deep dry ditches; the walls about
the bastions and citadel are a noble piece of masonry. The church is more
glorious without than within; the market place large; but the inhabitants
are miserably poor. The next day, we came to Abbeville, having passed all
this way in continual expectation of the volunteers, as they call them.
This town affords a good aspect toward the hill from whence we descended:
nor does it deceive us; for it is handsomely built, and has many pleasant
and useful streams passing through it, the main river being the Somme,
which discharges itself into the sea at St. Valery, almost in view of the
town. The principal church is a very handsome piece of Gothic
architecture, and the ports and ramparts sweetly planted for defense and
ornament. In the morning, they brought us choice of guns and pistols to
sell at reasonable rates, and neatly made, being here a merchandise of
great account, the town abounding in gunsmiths.

[Sidenote: ST. DENIS]

[Sidenote: PARIS]

Hence we advanced to Beauvais, another town of good note, and having the
first vineyards we had seen. The next day to Beaumont, and the morrow to
Paris, having taken our repast at St. Denis, two leagues from that great
city. St. Denis is considerable only for its stately cathedral, and the
dormitory of the French kings, there inhumed as ours at Westminster
Abbey. The treasury is esteemed one of the richest in Europe. The church
was built by King Dagobert,[15] but since much enlarged, being now 390
feet long, 100 in breadth, and 80 in height, without comprehending the
cover: it has also a very high shaft of stone, and the gates are of
brass. Here, while the monks conducted us, we were showed the ancient and
modern sepulchers of their kings, beginning with the founder to Louis his
son, with Charles Martel and Pepin, son and father of Charlemagne. These
lie in the choir, and without it are many more: among the rest that of
Bertrand du Guesclin, Constable of France; in the chapel of Charles V.,
all his posterity; and near him the magnificent sepulcher of Francis I.,
with his children, wars, victories, and triumphs engraven in marble. In
the nave of the church lies the catafalque, or hearse, of Louis XIII.,
Henry II., a noble tomb of Francis II., and Charles IX. Above are bodies
of several Saints; below, under a state of black velvet, the late Louis
XIII., father of this present monarch. Every one of the ten chapels, or
oratories, had some Saints in them; among the rest, one of the Holy
Innocents. The treasury is kept in the sacristy above, in which are
crosses of massy gold and silver, studded with precious stones, one of
gold three feet high, set with sapphires, rubies, and great oriental
pearls. Another given by Charles the Great, having a noble amethyst in
the middle of it, stones and pearls of inestimable value. Among the still
more valuable relics are, a nail from our Savior's Cross, in a box of
gold full of precious stones; a crucifix of the true wood of the Cross,
carved by Pope Clement III., enchased in a crystal covered with gold; a
box in which is some of the Virgin's hair; some of the linen in which our
blessed Savior was wrapped at his nativity; in a huge reliquary, modeled
like a church, some of our Savior's blood, hair, clothes, linen with
which he wiped the Apostles' feet; with many other equally authentic
toys, which the friar who conducted us would have us believe were
authentic relics. Among the treasures is the crown of Charlemagne, his
seven-foot high scepter and hand of justice, the agraffe of his royal
mantle, beset with diamonds and rubies, his sword, belt, and spurs of
gold; the crown of St. Louis, covered with precious stones, among which
is one vast ruby, uncut, of inestimable value, weighing 300 carats (under
which is set one of the thorns of our blessed Savior's crown), his
sword, seal, and hand of justice. The two crowns of Henry IV., his
scepter, hand of justice, and spurs. The two crowns of his son Louis. In
the cloak-royal of Anne of Bretagne is a very great and rare ruby. Divers
books covered with solid plates of gold, and studded with precious
stones. Two vases of beryl, two of agate, whereof one is esteemed for its
bigness, color, and embossed carving, the best now to be seen: by a
special favor I was permitted to take the measure and dimensions of it;
the story is a Bacchanalia and sacrifice to Priapus; a very holy thing
truly, and fit for a cloister! It is really antique, and the noblest
jewel there. There is also a large gondola of chrysolite, a huge urn of
porphyry, another of calcedon, a vase of onyx, the largest I had ever
seen of that stone; two of crystal; a morsel of one of the waterpots in
which our Savior did his first miracle; the effigies of the Queen of
Saba, of Julius, Augustus, Mark Antony, Cleopatra, and others, upon
sapphires, topazes, agates, and cornelians: that of the queen of Saba[16]
has a Moorish face; those of Julius and Nero on agates are rarely colored
and cut. A cup in which Solomon was used to drink, and an Apollo on a
great amethyst. There lay in a window a mirror of a kind of stone said to
have belonged to the poet Virgil. Charlemagne's chessmen, full of Arabic
characters. In the press next the door, the brass lantern full of
crystals, said to have conducted Judas and his company to apprehend our
blessed Savior. A fair unicorn's horn, sent by a king of Persia, about
seven feet long. In another press (over which stands the picture in oil
of their Orleans Amazon with her sword), the effigies of the late French
kings in wax, like ours in Westminster, covered with their robes; with a
world of other rarities. Having rewarded our courteous friar, we took
horse for Paris, where we arrived about five in the afternoon. In the way
were fair crosses of stone carved with fleur-de-lis at every furlong's
end, where they affirm St. Denis rested and laid down his head after
martyrdom, carrying it from the place where this monastery is builded. We
lay at Paris at the Ville de Venice; where, after I had something
refreshed, I went to visit Sir Richard Browne, his Majesty's Resident
with the French king.

    [Footnote 15: A. D. 630.]

    [Footnote 16: Or Sheba.]

5th December, 1643. The Earl of Norwich came as Ambassador extraordinary:
I went to meet him in a coach and six horses, at the palace of Monsieur
de Bassompière, where I saw that gallant person, his gardens, terraces,
and rare prospects. My lord was waited on by the master of the
ceremonies, and a very great cavalcade of men of quality, to the Palais
Cardinal, where on the 23d he had audience of the French king, and the
queen Regent his mother, in the golden chamber of presence. From thence,
I conducted him to his lodgings in Rue St. Denis, and so took my leave.

24th December, 1643. I went with some company to see some remarkable
places without the city: as the Isle, and how it is encompassed by the
Rivers Seine and the Ouse. The city is divided into three parts, whereof
the town is greatest. The city lies between it and the University in form
of an island. Over the Seine is a stately bridge called Pont Neuf, begun
by Henry III. in 1578, finished by Henry IV. his successor. It is all of
hewn freestone found under the streets, but more plentifully at
Montmartre, and consists of twelve arches, in the midst of which ends the
point of an island, on which are built handsome artificers' houses. There
is one large passage for coaches, and two for foot passengers three or
four feet higher, and of convenient breadth for eight or ten to go
abreast. On the middle of this stately bridge, on one side, stands the
famous statue of Henry the Great on horseback, exceeding the natural
proportion by much; and, on the four faces of a stately pedestal (which
is composed of various sorts of polished marbles and rich moldings),
inscriptions of his victories and most signal actions are engraven in
brass. The statue and horse are of copper, the work of the great John di
Bologna, and sent from Florence by Ferdinand the First, and Cosmo the
Second, uncle and cousin to Mary de Medicis, the wife of King Henry,
whose statue it represents. The place where it is erected is inclosed
with a strong and beautiful grate of iron, about which there are always
mountebanks showing their feats to the idle passengers. From hence is a
rare prospect toward the Louvre and suburbs of St. Germains, the Isle du
Palais, and Nôtre Dame. At the foot of this bridge is a water-house, on
the front whereof, at a great height, is the story of Our Savior and the
woman of Samaria pouring water out of a bucket. Above, is a very rare
dial of several motions, with a chime, etc. The water is conveyed by huge
wheels, pumps, and other engines, from the river beneath. The confluence
of the people and multitude of coaches passing every moment over the
bridge, to a new spectator is an agreeable diversion. Other bridges there
are, as that of Nôtre Dame and the Pont-au-Change, etc., fairly built,
with houses of stone, which are laid over this river; only the Pont St.
Anne, landing the suburbs of St. Germains at the Tuileries, is built of
wood, having likewise a water house in the midst of it, and a statue of
Neptune casting water out of a whale's mouth, of lead, but much inferior
to the Samaritan.

The University lies southwest on higher ground, contiguous to, but the
lesser part of, Paris. They reckon no less than sixty-five colleges; but
they in nothing approach ours at Oxford for state and order. The
booksellers dwell within the University. The schools (of which more
hereafter) are very regular.

The suburbs are those of St. Denis, Honoré, St. Marcel, St. Jaques, St.
Michael, St. Victoire, and St. Germains, which last is the largest, and
where the nobility and persons of best quality are seated: and truly
Paris, comprehending the suburbs, is, for the material the houses are
built with, and many noble and magnificent piles, one of the most gallant
cities in the world; large in circuit, of a round form, very populous,
but situated in a bottom, environed with gentle declivities, rendering
some places very dirty, and making it smell as if sulphur were mingled
with the mud; yet it is paved with a kind of freestone, of near a foot
square, which renders it more easy to walk on than our pebbles in London.

On Christmas eve, I went to see the Cathedral at Nôtre Dame, erected by
Philip Augustus, but begun by King Robert, son of Hugh Capet. It consists
of a Gothic fabric, sustained with 120 pillars, which make two aisles in
the church round about the choir, without comprehending the chapels,
being 174 paces long, 60 wide, and 100 high. The choir is inclosed with
stonework graven with the sacred history, and contains forty-five chapels
chancelled with iron. At the front of the chief entrance are statues in
relievo of the kings, twenty-eight in number, from Childebert to the
founder, Philip; and above them are two high square towers, and another
of a smaller size, bearing a spire in the middle, where the body of the
church forms a cross. The great tower is ascended by 389 steps, having
twelve galleries from one to the other. They greatly reverence the
crucifix over the screen of the choir, with an image of the Blessed
Virgin. There are some good modern paintings hanging on the pillars. The
most conspicuous statute is the huge colossal one of St. Christopher;
with divers other figures of men, houses, prospects and rocks, about this
gigantic piece; being of one stone, and more remarkable for its bulk than
any other perfection. This is the prime church of France for dignity,
having archdeacons, vicars, canons, priests, and chaplains in good store,
to the number of 127. It is also the palace of the archbishop. The young
king was there with a great and martial guard, who entered the nave of
the church with drums and fifes, at the ceasing of which I was
entertained with the church music; and so I left him.

4th January, 1644. I passed this day with one Mr. J. Wall, an Irish
gentleman, who had been a friar in Spain, and afterward a reader in St.
Isodore's chair, at Rome; but was, I know not how, getting away, and
pretending to be a soldier of fortune, an absolute cavalier, having, as
he told us, been a captain of horse in Germany. It is certain he was an
excellent disputant, and so strangely given to it that nothing could pass
him. He would needs persuade me to go with him this morning to the
Jesuits' College, to witness his polemical talent. We found the Fathers
in their Church at the Rue St. Antoine, where one of them showed us that
noble fabric, which for its cupola, pavings, incrustations of marble, the
pulpit, altars (especially the high altar), organ, lavatorium, etc., but
above all, for the richly carved and incomparable front I esteem to be
one of the most perfect pieces of architecture in Europe, emulating even
some of the greatest now at Rome itself. But this not being what our
friar sought, he led us into the adjoining convent, where, having shown
us the library, they began a very hot dispute on some points of divinity,
which our cavalier contested only to show his pride, and to that
indiscreet height, that the Jesuits would hardly bring us to our coach,
they being put beside all patience. The next day, we went into the
University, and into the College of Navarre, which is a spacious,
well-built quadrangle, having a very noble library.

Thence to the Sorbonne, an ancient fabric built by one Robert de
Sorbonne, whose name it retains, but the restoration which the late
Cardinal de Richelieu has made to it renders it one of the most excellent
modern buildings; the sumptuous church, of admirable architecture, is far
superior to the rest. The cupola, portico, and whole design of the
church, are very magnificent.

We entered into some of the schools, and in that of divinity we found a
grave Doctor in his chair, with a multitude of auditors, who all write as
he dictates; and this they call a Course. After we had sat a little, our
cavalier started up, and rudely enough began to dispute with the doctor;
at which, and especially as he was clad in the Spanish habit, which in
Paris is the greatest bugbear imaginable, the scholars and doctor fell
into such a fit of laughter, that nobody could be heard speak for a
while: but silence being obtained, he began to speak Latin, and made his
apology in so good a style, that their derision was turned to admiration;
and beginning to argue, he so baffled the Professor, that with universal
applause they all rose up, and did him great honors, waiting on us to the
very street and our coach, and testifying great satisfaction.

2d February, 1644. I heard the news of my nephew George's birth, which
was on January 15th, English style, 1644.

3d February, 1644. I went to the Exchange. The late addition to the
buildings is very noble; but the galleries where they sell their petty
merchandise nothing so stately as ours at London, no more than the place
where they walk below, being only a low vault.

The Palaise, as they call the upper part, was built in the time of Philip
the Fair, noble and spacious. The great Hall annexed to it, is arched
with stone, having a range of pillars in the middle, round which, and at
the sides, are shops of all kinds, especially booksellers'. One side is
full of pews for the clerks of the advocates, who swarm here (as ours at
Westminster). At one of the ends stands an altar, at which mass is said
daily. Within are several chambers, courts, treasuries, etc. Above that
is the most rich and glorious Salle d'Audience, the chamber of St.
Louis, and other superior Courts where the Parliament sits, richly gilt
on embossed carvings and frets, and exceedingly beautified.

Within the place where they sell their wares, is another narrower
gallery, full of shops and toys, etc., which looks down into the
prison-yard. Descending by a large pair of stairs, we passed by Sainte
Chapelle, which is a church built by St. Louis, 1242, after the Gothic
manner: it stands on another church, which is under it, sustained by
pillars at the sides, which seem so weak as to appear extraordinary in
the artist. This chapel is most famous for its relics, having as they
pretend, almost the entire crown of thorns: the agate patine, rarely
sculptured, judged one of the largest and best in Europe. There was now a
very beautiful spire erecting. The court below is very spacious, capable
of holding many coaches, and surrounded with shops, especially
engravers', goldsmiths', and watchmakers'. In it are a fair fountain and
portico. The Isle du Palais consists of a triangular brick building,
whereof one side, looking to the river, is inhabited by goldsmiths.
Within the court are private dwellings. The front, looking on the great
bridge, is possessed by mountebanks, operators, and puppet-players. On
the other part, is the every day's market for all sorts of provisions,
especially bread, herbs, flowers, orange trees, choice shrubs. Here is a
shop called NOAH'S ARK, where are sold all curiosities, natural or
artificial, Indian or European, for luxury or use, as cabinets, shells,
ivory, porcelain, dried fishes, insects, birds, pictures, and a thousand
exotic extravagances. Passing hence, we viewed the port Dauphine, an arch
of excellent workmanship; the street bearing the same name, is ample and
straight.

4th February, 1644. I went to see the Marais de Temple, where are a noble
church and palace, heretofore dedicated to the Knights Templar, now
converted to a piazza, not much unlike ours at Covent Garden; but large
and not so pleasant, though built all about with divers considerable
palaces.

The Church of St. Geneviève is a place of great devotion, dedicated to
another of their Amazons, said to have delivered the city from the
English; for which she is esteemed the tutelary saint of Paris. It stands
on a steep eminence, having a very high spire, and is governed by canons
regular. At the Palais Royal Henry IV. built a fair quadrangle of stately
palaces, arched underneath. In the middle of a spacious area, stands on a
noble pedestal a brazen statue of Louis XIII., which, though made in
imitation of that in the Roman capitol, is nothing so much esteemed as
that on the Pont Neuf.

The hospital of the Quinze-Vingts, in the Rue St. Honoré, is an excellent
foundation; but above all is the Hôtel Dieu for men and women, near Nôtre
Dame, a princely, pious, and expensive structure. That of the Charité
gave me great satisfaction, in seeing how decently and christianly the
sick people are attended, even to delicacy. I have seen them served by
noble persons, men and women. They have also gardens, walks, and
fountains. Divers persons are here cut for the stone, with great success,
yearly in May. The two Châtelets (supposed to have been built by Julius
Cæsar) are places of judicature in criminal causes; to which is a strong
prison. The courts are spacious and magnificent.

8th February, 1644. I took coach and went to see the famous Jardine
Royale, which is an inclosure walled in, consisting of all varieties of
ground for planting and culture of medical simples. It is well chosen,
having in it hills, meadows, wood and upland, natural and artificial, and
is richly stored with exotic plants. In the middle of the parterre is a
fair fountain. There is a very fine house, chapel, laboratory, orangery,
and other accommodations for the President, who is always one of the
king's chief physicians.

From hence, we went to the other side of the town, and to some distance
from it, to the Bois de Vincennes, going by the Bastille, which is the
fortress, tower, and magazine of this great city. It is very spacious
within, and there the Grand Master of the artillery has his house, with
fair gardens and walks.

The Bois de Vincennes has in it a square and noble castle, with
magnificent apartments, fit for a royal court, not forgetting the chapel.
It is the chief prison for persons of quality. About it there is a park
walled in, full of deer; and in one part there is a grove of goodly pine
trees.

The next day, I went to see the Louvre with more attention, its several
courts and pavilions. One of the quadrangles, begun by Henry IV., and
finished by his son and grandson, is a superb, but mixed structure. The
cornices, moldings, and compartments, with the insertion of several
colored marbles, have been of great expense.

We went through the long gallery, paved with white and black marble,
richly fretted and painted _à fresco_. The front looking to the river,
though of rare work for the carving, yet wants of that magnificence which
a plainer and truer design would have contributed to it.

In the Cour aux Tuileries is a princely fabric; the winding geometrical
stone stairs, with the cupola, I take to be as bold and noble a piece of
architecture as any in Europe of the kind. To this is a _corps de logis_,
worthy of so great a prince. Under these buildings, through a garden in
which is an ample fountain, was the king's printing house, and that
famous letter so much esteemed. Here I bought divers of the classic
authors, poets, and others.

We returned through another gallery, larger, but not so long, where hung
the pictures of all the kings and queens and prime nobility of France.

Descending hence, we were let into a lower very large room, called the
_Salle des Antiques_, which is a vaulted Cimelia, destined for statues
only, among which stands that so celebrated Diana of the Ephesians, said
to be the same which uttered oracles in that renowned Temple. Besides
these colossean figures of marble, I must not forget the huge globe
suspended by chains. The pavings, inlayings, and incrustations of this
Hall, are very rich.

In another more private garden toward the Queen's apartment is a walk, or
cloister, under arches, whose terrace is paved with stones of a great
breadth; it looks toward the river, and has a pleasant aviary, fountain,
stately cypresses, etc. On the river are seen a prodigious number of
barges and boats of great length, full of hay, corn, wood, wine, and
other commodities, which this vast city daily consumes. Under the long
gallery we have described, dwell goldsmiths, painters, statuaries, and
architects, who being the most famous for their art in Christendom have
stipends allowed them by the King. Into that of Monsieur Saracin we
entered, who was then molding for an image of a Madonna to be cast in
gold of a great size to be sent by the Queen Regent to Loretto, as an
offering for the birth of the Dauphin, now the young King.

I finished this day with a walk in the great garden of the Tuileries,
rarely contrived for privacy, shade, or company, by groves, plantations
of tall trees, especially that in the middle, being of elms, the other of
mulberries; and that labyrinth of cypresses; not omitting the noble
hedges of pomegranates, fountains, fish-ponds, and an aviary; but, above
all, the artificial echo, redoubling the words so distinctly; and, as it
is never without some fair nymph singing to its grateful returns;
standing at one of the focuses, which is under a tree or little cabinet
of hedges, the voice seems to descend from the clouds; at another, as if
it was underground. This being at the bottom of the garden, we were let
into another, which being kept with all imaginary accurateness as to the
orangery, precious shrubs, and rare fruits, seemed a Paradise. From a
terrace in this place we saw so many coaches, as one would hardly think
could be maintained in the whole city, going, late as it was in the year,
toward the course, which is a place adjoining, of near an English mile
long, planted with four rows of trees, making a large circle in the
middle. This course is walled about, near breast high, with squared
freestone, and has a stately arch at the entrance, with sculpture and
statues about it, built by Mary di Medicis. Here it is that the gallants
and ladies of the Court take the air and divert themselves, as with us in
Hyde Park, the circle being capable of containing a hundred coaches to
turn commodiously, and the larger of the plantations for five or six
coaches abreast.

Returning through the Tuileries, we saw a building in which are kept wild
beasts for the King's pleasure, a bear, a wolf, a wild boar, a leopard,
etc.

[Sidenote: ST. CLOUD]

27th February, 1644. Accompanied with some English gentlemen, we took
horse to see St. Germains-en-Laye, a stately country house of the King,
some five leagues from Paris. By the way, we alighted at St. Cloud,
where, on an eminence near the river, the Archbishop of Paris has a
garden, for the house is not very considerable, rarely watered and
furnished with fountains, statues, and groves; the walks are very fair;
the fountain of Laocoon is in a large square pool, throwing the water
near forty feet high, and having about it a multitude of statues and
basins, and is a surprising object. But nothing is more esteemed than the
cascade falling from the great steps into the lowest and longest walk
from the Mount Parnassus, which consists of a grotto, or shell-house, on
the summit of the hill, wherein are divers waterworks and contrivances to
wet the spectators; this is covered with a fair cupola, the walls painted
with the Muses, and statues placed thick about it, whereof some are
antique and good. In the upper walks are two perspectives, seeming to
enlarge the alleys, and in this garden are many other ingenious
contrivances. The palace, as I said, is not extraordinary. The outer
walls only painted _à fresco_. In the court is a Volary, and the statues
of Charles IX., Henry III., IV., and Louis XIII., on horseback,
mezzo-relievo'd in plaster. In the garden is a small chapel; and under
shelter is the figure of Cleopatra, taken from the Belvidere original,
with others. From the terrace above is a tempest well painted; and thence
an excellent prospect toward Paris, the meadows, and river.

At an inn in this village is a host who treats all the great persons in
princely lodgings for furniture and plate, but they pay well for it, as I
have done. Indeed, the entertainment is very splendid, and not
unreasonable, considering the excellent manner of dressing their meat,
and of the service. Here are many debauches and excessive revelings, as
being out of all noise and observance.

[Sidenote: ST. GERMAINS]

From hence, about a league further, we went to see Cardinal Richelieu's
villa, at Ruell. The house is small, but fairly built, in form of a
castle, moated round. The offices are toward the road, and over against
it are large vineyards, walled in. But, though the house is not of the
greatest, the gardens about it are so magnificent, that I doubt whether
Italy has any exceeding it for all rarities of pleasure. The garden
nearest the pavilion is a parterre, having in the midst divers noble
brass statues, perpetually spouting water into an ample basin, with other
figures of the same metal; but what is most admirable is the vast
inclosure, and variety of ground, in the large garden, containing
vineyards, cornfields, meadows, groves (whereof one is of perennial
greens), and walks of vast length, so accurately kept and cultivated,
that nothing can be more agreeable. On one of these walks, within a
square of tall trees, is a basilisk of copper, which, managed by the
fountaineer, casts water near sixty feet high, and will of itself move
round so swiftly, that one can hardly escape wetting. This leads to the
Citronière, which is a noble conserve of all those rarities; and at the
end of it is the Arch of Constantine, painted on a wall in oil, as large
as the real one at Rome, so well done, that even a man skilled in
painting, may mistake it for stone and sculpture. The sky and hills,
which seem to be between the arches, are so natural, that swallows and
other birds, thinking to fly through, have dashed themselves against the
wall. I was infinitely taken with this agreeable cheat. At the further
part of this walk is that plentiful, though artificial cascade, which
rolls down a very steep declivity, and over the marble steps and basins,
with an astonishing noise and fury; each basin hath a jetto in it,
flowing like sheets of transparent glass, especially that which rises
over the great shell of lead, from whence it glides silently down a
channel through the middle of a spacious gravel walk, terminating in a
grotto. Here are also fountains that cast water to a great height, and
large ponds, two of which have islands for harbor of fowls, of which
there is store. One of these islands has a receptacle for them built of
vast pieces of rock, near fifty feet high, grown over with moss, ivy,
etc., shaded at a competent distance with tall trees: in this rupellary
nidary do the fowl lay eggs, and breed. We then saw a large and very rare
grotto of shell-work, in the shape of Satyrs, and other wild fancies: in
the middle stands a marble table, on which a fountain plays in divers
forms of glasses, cups, crosses, fans, crowns, etc. Then the fountaineer
represented a shower of rain from the top, met by small jets from below.
At going out, two extravagant musketeers shot us with a stream of water
from their musket barrels. Before this grotto is a long pool into which
ran divers spouts of water from leaden escalop basins. The viewing this
paradise made us late at St. Germains.

The first building of this palace is of Charles V., called the Sage; but
Francis I. (that true virtuoso) made it complete; speaking as to the
style of magnificence then in fashion, which was with too great a mixture
of the Gothic, as may be seen in what there is remaining of his in the
old Castle, an irregular piece as built on the old foundation, and having
a moat about it. It has yet some spacious and handsome rooms of state,
and a chapel neatly painted. The new Castle is at some distance, divided
from this by a court, of a lower, but more modern design, built by Henry
IV. To this belong six terraces, built of brick and stone, descending in
cascades toward the river, cut out of the natural hill, having under them
goodly vaulted galleries; of these, four have subterranean grots and
rocks, where are represented several objects in the manner of scenes and
other motions, by force of water, shown by the light of torches only;
among these, is Orpheus with his music; and the animals, which dance
after his harp; in the second, is the King and Dolphin;[17] in the third,
is Neptune sounding his trumpet, his chariot drawn by sea horses; in the
fourth, the story of Perseus and Andromeda; mills; hermitages; men
fishing; birds chirping; and many other devices. There is also a dry grot
to refresh in; all having a fine prospect toward the river, and the
goodly country about it, especially the forest. At the bottom, is a
parterre; the upper terrace nearly half a mile in length, with double
declivities, arched and balustered with stone, of vast and royal cost.

    [Footnote 17: Dauphin.]

In the pavilion of the new Castle are many fair rooms, well painted, and
leading into a very noble garden and park, where is a pall-mall, in the
midst of which, on one of the sides, is a chapel, with stone cupola,
though small, yet of a handsome order of architecture. Out of the park
you go into the forest, which being very large, is stored with deer, wild
boars, wolves, and other wild game. The Tennis Court, and Cavallerizzo,
for the menaged horses, are also observable.

[Sidenote: PARIS]

We returned to Paris by Madrid, another villa of the King's, built by
Francis I., and called by that name to absolve him of his oath that he
would not go from Madrid (in which he was prisoner), in Spain, but from
whence he made his escape. This house is also built in a park, and
walled in. We next called in at the Bonnes-hommes, well situated, with a
fair chapel and library.

1st March, 1644. I went to see the Count de Liancourt's Palace in the Rue
de Seine, which is well built. Toward his study and bedchamber joins a
little garden, which, though very narrow, by the addition of a
well-painted perspective, is to appearance greatly enlarged; to this
there is another part, supported by arches in which runs a stream of
water, rising in the aviary, out of a statue, and seeming to flow for
some miles, by being artificially continued in the painting, when it
sinks down at the wall. It is a very agreeable deceit. At the end of this
garden is a little theater, made to change with divers pretty scenes, and
the stage so ordered, with figures of men and women painted on light
boards, and cut out, and, by a person who stands underneath, made to act
as if they were speaking, by guiding them, and reciting words in
different tones, as the parts require. We were led into a round cabinet,
where was a neat invention for reflecting lights, by lining divers
sconces with thin shining plates of gilded copper.

In one of the rooms of state was an excellent painting of Poussin, being
a Satyr kneeling; over the chimney, the Coronation of the Virgin, by
Paulo Veronese; another Madonna over the door, and that of Joseph, by
Cigali; in the Hall, a Cavaliero di Malta, attended by his page, said to
be of Michael Angelo; the Rape of Proserpine, with a very large landscape
of Correggio. In the next room are some paintings of Primaticcio,
especially the Helena, the naked Lady brought before Alexander, well
painted, and a Ceres. In the bedchamber a picture of the Cardinal de
Liancourt, of Raphael, rarely colored. In the cabinet are divers pieces
of Bassano, two of Polemburg, four of Paulo Brill, the skies a little too
blue. A Madonna of Nicholao, excellently painted on a stone; a Judith of
Mantegna; three women of Jeronimo; one of Stenwick; a Madonna after
Titian, and a Magdalen of the same hand, as the Count esteems it: two
small pieces of Paulo Veronese, being the Martyrdoms of St. Justina and
St. Catherine; a Madonna of Lucas Van Leyden, sent him from our King; six
more of old Bassano; two excellent drawings of Albert; a Magdalen of
Leonardo da Vinci; four of Paulo; a very rare Madonna of Titian, given
him also by our King; the _Ecce Homo_, shut up in a frame of velvet, for
the life and accurate finishing exceeding all description. Some curious
agates, and a chaplet of admirable invention, the intaglios being all on
fruit stones. The Count was so exceeding civil, that he would needs make
his lady go out of her dressing room, that he might show us the
curiosities and pictures in it.

We went thence to visit one Monsieur Perishot, one of the greatest
virtuosos in France, for his collection of pictures, agates, medals, and
flowers, especially tulips and anemonies. The chiefest of his paintings
was a Sebastian, of Titian.

From him we went to Monsieur Frene's, who showed us many rare drawings, a
Rape of Helen in black chalk; many excellent things of Sneiders, all
naked; some of Julio and Michael Angelo; a Madonna of Passignano; some
things of Parmensis, and other masters.

The next morning, being recommended to one Monsieur de Hausse, President
of the Parliament, and once Ambassador at Venice for the French King, we
were very civilly received, and showed his library. Among his paintings
were a rare Venus and Adonis of Veronese, a St. Anthony, after the first
manner of Correggio, and a rare Madonna of Palma.

Sunday, the 6th of March, I went to Charenton, two leagues from Paris, to
hear and see the manner of the French Protestant Church service. The
place of meeting they call the Temple, a very fair and spacious room,
built of freestone, very decently adorned with paintings of the Tables of
the Law, the Lord's Prayer, and Creed. The pulpit stands at the upper end
in the middle, having an inclosure of seats about it, where the Elders
and persons of greatest quality and strangers, sit; the rest of the
congregation on forms and low stools, but none in pews, as in our
churches, to their great disgrace, as nothing so orderly, as here the
stools and other cumber are removed when the assembly rises. I was
greatly pleased with their harmonious singing the Psalms, which they all
learn perfectly well, their children being as duly taught these, as their
catechism.

In our passage, we went by that famous bridge over the Marne, where that
renowned echo returns the voice of a good singer nine or ten times.

7th March, 1644. I set forward with some company toward Fontainebleau, a
sumptuous Palace of the King's, like ours at Hampton Court, about
fourteen leagues from the city. By the way, we pass through a forest so
prodigiously encompassed with hideous rocks of whitish hard stone, heaped
one on another in mountainous heights, that I think the like is nowhere
to be found more horrid and solitary. It abounds with stags, wolves,
boars, and not long after a lynx, or ounce, was killed among them, which
had devoured some passengers. On the summit of one of these gloomy
precipices, intermingled with trees and shrubs, the stones hanging over,
and menacing ruin, is built an hermitage. In these solitudes, rogues
frequently lurk and do mischief (and for whom we were all well appointed
with our carabines); but we arrived safe in the evening at the village,
where we lay at the Horne, going early next morning to the Palace.

This House is nothing so stately and uniform as Hampton Court, but
Francis I. began much to beautify it; most of all Henry IV. (and not a
little) the late King. It abounds with fair halls, chambers, and
galleries; in the longest, which is 360 feet long, and 18 broad, are
painted the Victories of that great Prince, Henry IV. That of Francis I.,
called the grand Gallery, has all the King's palaces painted in it; above
these, in sixty pieces of excellent work in fresco, is the History of
Ulysses, from Homer, by Primaticcio, in the time of Henry III., esteemed
the most renowned in Europe for the design. The Cabinet is full of
excellent pictures, especially a Woman, of Raphael. In the Hall of the
Guards is a piece of tapestry painted on the wall, very naturally,
representing the victories of Charles VII. over our countrymen. In the
Salle des Festins is a rare Chimney-piece, and Henry IV. on horseback, of
white marble, esteemed worth 18,000 crowns; Clementia and Pax, nobly
done. On columns of jasper, two lions of brass. The new stairs, and a
half circular court, are of modern and good architecture, as is a chapel
built by Louis XIII., all of jasper, with several incrustations of marble
through the inside.

Having seen the rooms, we went to the volary, which has a cupola in the
middle of it, great trees and bushes, it being full of birds who drank at
two fountains. There is also a fair tennis court, and noble stables; but
the beauty of all are the gardens. In the Court of the Fountains stand
divers antiquities and statues, especially a Mercury. In the Queen's
Garden is a Diana ejecting a fountain, with numerous other brass statues.

The great Garden, 180 toises long and 154 wide, has in the center a
fountain of Tyber of a Colossean figure of brass, with the Wolf over
Romulus and Remus. At each corner of the garden rises a fountain. In the
garden of the piscina, is a Hercules of white marble; next, is that of
the pines, and without that a canal of an English mile in length, at the
end of which rise three jettos in the form of a fleur-de-lis, of a great
height; on the margin are excellent walks planted with trees. The carps
come familiarly to hand (to be fed). Hence they brought us to a spring,
which they say being first discovered by a dog, gave occasion of
beautifying this place, both with the palace and gardens. The white and
terrific rocks at some distance in the forest, yield one of the most
august and stupendous prospects imaginable. The park about this place is
very large, and the town full of noblemen's houses.

Next morning, we were invited by a painter, who was keeper of the
pictures and rarities, to see his own collection. We were led through a
gallery of old Rosso's work, at the end of which, in another cabinet,
were three Madonnas of Raphael, and two of Andrea del Sarto. In the
Academy where the painter himself wrought, was a St. Michael of Raphael,
very rare; St. John Baptist of Leonardo, and a Woman's head; a Queen of
Sicily, and St. Margaret of Raphael; two more Madonnas, whereof one very
large, by the same hand; some more of del Sarto; a St. Jerome, of Perino
del Vaga; the Rape of Proserpine, very good; and a great number of
drawings.

Returning part of our way to Paris, that day, we visited a house called
_Maison Rouge_, having an excellent prospect, grot, and fountains, one
whereof rises fifty feet, and resembles the noise of a tempest, battle of
guns, etc., at its issue.

Thence to Essone, a house of Monsieur Essling, who is a great virtuoso;
there are many good paintings in it; but nothing so observable as his
gardens, fountains, fish-pools, especially that in a triangular form, the
water cast out by a multitude of heads about it; there is a noble
cascade and pretty baths, with all accommodations. Under a marble table
is a fountain of serpents twisting about a globe.

We alighted next at Corbeil, a town famous for the siege by Henry IV.
Here we slept, and returned next morning to Paris.

18th March, 1644. I went with Sir J. Cotton, a Cambridgeshire Knight, a
journey into Normandy. The first day, we passed by Gaillon, the
Archbishop of Rouen's Palace. The gardens are highly commended, but we
did not go in, intending to reach Pontoise by dinner. This town is built
in a very gallant place, has a noble bridge over the Oise, and is well
refreshed with fountains.

This is the first town in Normandy, and the furthest that the vineyards
extend to on this side of the country, which is fuller of plains, wood,
and inclosures, with some towns toward the sea, very like England.

[Sidenote: ROUEN]

We lay this night at a village, called Magny. The next day, descending a
very steep hill, we dined at Fleury, after riding five leagues down St.
Catherine, to Rouen, which affords a goodly prospect, to the ruins of
that chapel and mountain. This country so abounds with wolves that a
shepherd whom we met, told us one of his companions was strangled by one
of them the day before, and that in the midst of his flock. The fields
are mostly planted with pears and apples, and other cider fruits. It is
plentifully furnished with quarries of stone and slate, and hath iron in
abundance.

I lay at the White Cross, in Rouen, which is a very large city, on the
Seine, having two smaller rivers besides, called the Aubette and Robec.
There stand yet the ruins of a magnificent bridge of stone, now supplied
by one of boats only, to which come up vessels of considerable burden.
The other side of the water consists of meadows, and there have the
Reformed a church.

The Cathedral Nôtre Dame was built, as they acknowledge, by the English;
some English words graven in Gothic characters upon the front seem to
confirm it. The towers and whole church are full of carving. It has three
steeples, with a pyramid; in one of these, I saw the famous bell so much
talked of, thirteen feet in height, thirty-two round, the diameter
eleven, weighing 40,000 pounds.

In the Chapel d'Amboise, built by a Cardinal of that name, lies his body,
with several fair monuments. The choir has behind it a great dragon
painted on the wall, which they say had done much harm to the
inhabitants, till vanquished by St. Romain, their Archbishop; for which
there is an annual procession. It was now near Easter, and many images
were exposed with scenes and stories representing the Passion; made up of
little puppets, to which there was great resort and devotion, with
offerings. Before the church is a fair palace. St. Ouen is another goodly
church and an abbey with fine gardens. Here the King hath lodgings, when
he makes his progress through these parts. The structure, where the Court
of Parliament is kept, is very magnificent, containing very fair halls
and chambers, especially La Chambre Dorée. The town-house is also well
built, and so are some gentlemen's houses; but most part of the rest are
of timber, like our merchants' in London, in the wooden part of the city.

21st March, 1644. On Easter Monday, we dined at Totes, a solitary inn
between Rouen and Dieppe, at which latter place we arrived. This town is
situated between two mountains, not unpleasantly, and is washed on the
north by our English seas.

The port is commodious; but the entrance difficult. It has one very ample
and fair street, in which is a pretty church. The Fort Pollet consists of
a strong earth-work, and commands the haven, as on the other side does
the castle, which is also well fortified, with the citadel before it; nor
is the town itself a little strong. It abounds with workmen, who make and
sell curiosities of ivory and tortoise-shells; and indeed whatever the
East Indies afford of cabinets, porcelain, natural and exotic rarities,
are here to be had, with abundant choice.

23d March, 1644. We passed along the coast by a very rocky and rugged
way, which forced us to alight many times before we came to Havre de
Grace, where we lay that night.

The next morning, we saw the citadel, strong and regular, well stored
with artillery and ammunition of all sorts: the works furnished with fair
brass cannon, having a motto, _Ratio ultima Regum_. The allogements of
the garrison are uniform; a spacious place for drawing up the soldiers,
a pretty chapel, and a fair house for the Governor. The Duke of Richelieu
being now in the fort, we went to salute him; who received us very
civilly, and commanded that we should be showed whatever we desired to
see. The citadel was built by the late Cardinal de Richelieu, uncle of
the present Duke, and may be esteemed one of the strongest in France. The
haven is very capacious.

When we had done here, we embarked ourselves and horses to pass to
Honfleur, about four or five leagues distant, where the Seine falls into
the sea. It is a poor fisher-town, remarkable for nothing so much as the
odd, yet useful habits which the good women wear, of bears' and other
skins, as of rugs at Dieppe, and all along these maritime coasts.

[Sidenote: CAEN]

25th March, 1644. We arrived at Caen, a noble and beautiful town, situate
on the river Orne, which passes quite through it, the two sides of the
town joined only by a bridge of one entire arch. We lay at the Angel,
where we were very well used, the place being abundantly furnished with
provisions, at a cheap rate. The most considerable object is the great
Abbey and Church, large and rich, built after the Gothic manner, having
two spires and middle lantern at the west end, all of stone. The choir
round and large, in the center whereof elevated on a square, handsome,
but plain sepulcher, is this inscription:

    "Hoc sepulchrum invictissimi juxta et clementissimi conquestoris,
    Gulielmi, dum viverat Anglorum Regis, Normannorum Cenomannorumque
    Principis, hujus insignis Abbatiae piissimi Fundatoris: Cum anno
    1562 vesano hæreticorum furore direptum fuisset, pio tandem
    nobilium ejusdem Abbatiae religiosorum gratitudinis sensu in tam
    beneficum largitorem, instauratum fuit, a^o D'ni 1642. D'no Johanne
    de Bailhache Assætorii proto priore. D.D."

On the other side are these monkish rhymes:

    "Qui rexit rigidos Northmannos, atq. Britannos
      Audacter vicit, fortiter obtinuit,
    Et Cenomanensis virtute coërcuit ensis,
      Imperiique sui Legibus applicuit.
    Rex magnus parvâ jacet hâc Gulielm' in Urnâ,
      Sufficit et magno parva domus Domino.
    Ter septem gradibus te volverat atq. duobus
      Virginis in gremio Phoebus, et hic obiit."

We went to the castle, which is strong and fair, and so is the
town-house, built on the bridge which unites the two towns. Here are
schools and an University for the Jurists.

The whole town is handsomely built of that excellent stone so well known
by that name in England. I was led to a pretty garden, planted with
hedges of alaternus, having at the entrance a screen at an exceeding
height, accurately cut in topiary work, with well understood
architecture, consisting of pillars, niches, friezes, and other
ornaments, with great curiosity; some of the columns curiously wreathed,
others spiral, all according to art.

[Sidenote: PARIS]

28th March, 1644. We went toward Paris, lying the first night at Evreux,
a Bishop's seat, an ancient town, with a fair cathedral; so the next day
we arrived at Paris.

1st April, 1644. I went to see more exactly the rooms of the fine Palace
of Luxemburg, in the Fauxbourg St. Germains, built by Mary di Medicis,
and I think one of the most noble, entire, and finished piles that is to
be seen, taking it with the garden and all its accomplishments. The
gallery is of the painting of Rubens, being the history of the
Foundress's Life, rarely designed; at the end of it is the Duke of
Orleans' library, well furnished with excellent books, all bound in
maroquin and gilded, the valance of the shelves being of green velvet,
fringed with gold. In the cabinet joining to it are only the smaller
volumes, with six cabinets of medals, and an excellent collection of
shells and agates, whereof some are prodigiously rich. This Duke being
very learned in medals and plants, nothing of that kind escapes him.
There are other spacious, noble, and princely furnished rooms, which look
toward the gardens, which are nothing inferior to the rest.

The court below is formed into a square by a corridor, having over the
chief entrance a stately cupola, covered with stone: the rest is
cloistered and arched on pilasters of rustic work. The terrace ascending
before the front, paved with white and black marble, is balustered with
white marble, exquisitely polished.

Only the hall below is low, and the staircase somewhat of a heavy design,
but the facia toward the parterre which is also arched and vaulted with
stone, is of admirable beauty and full of sculpture.

The gardens are near an English mile in compass, inclosed with a stately
wall, and in a good air. The parterre is indeed of box, but so rarely
designed and accurately kept cut, that the embroidery makes a wonderful
effect to the lodgings which front it. 'Tis divided into four squares and
as many circular knots, having in the center a noble basin of marble near
thirty feet in diameter (as I remember), in which a Triton of brass holds
a dolphin, that casts a girandola of water near thirty feet high, playing
perpetually, the water being conveyed from Arceuil by an aqueduct of
stone, built after the old Roman magnificence. About this ample parterre,
the spacious walks and all included, runs a border of freestone, adorned
with pedestals for pots and statues, and part of it near the steps of the
terrace, with a rail and baluster of pure white marble.

The walks are exactly fair, long, and variously descending and so justly
planted with limes, elms, and other trees, that nothing can be more
delicious, especially that of the hornbeam hedge, which being high and
stately, buts full on the fountain.

Toward the further end, is an excavation intended for a vast fish-pool,
but never finished, and near it is an inclosure for a garden of simples,
well kept; and here the Duke keeps tortoises in great number, who use the
pool of water on one side of the garden. Here is also a conservatory for
snow. At the upper part, toward the palace, is a grove of tall elms cut
into a star, every ray being a walk, whose center is a large fountain.

The rest of the ground is made into several inclosures (all hedge-work or
rows of trees) of whole fields, meadows, bocages, some of them containing
divers acres.

Next the street side, and more contiguous to the house, are knots in
trail, or grass work, where likewise runs a fountain. Toward the grotto
and stables, within a wall, is a garden of choice flowers, in which the
duke spends many thousand pistoles. In sum, nothing is wanted to render
this palace and gardens perfectly beautiful and magnificent; nor is it
one of the least diversions to see the number of persons of quality,
citizens and strangers, who frequent it, and to whom all access is freely
permitted, so that you shall see some walks and retirements full of
gallants and ladies; in others melancholy friars; in others, studious
scholars; in others, jolly citizens, some sitting or lying on the grass,
others running and jumping; some playing at bowls and ball, others
dancing and singing; and all this without the least disturbance, by
reason of the largeness of the place.

What is most admirable, you see no gardeners, or men at work, and yet all
is kept in such exquisite order, as if they did nothing else but work; it
is so early in the morning, that all is dispatched and done without the
least confusion.

I have been the larger in the description of this paradise, for the
extraordinary delight I have taken in those sweet retirements. The
Cabinet and Chapel nearer the garden-front have some choice pictures. All
the houses near this are also very noble palaces, especially Petite
Luxemburg. The ascent of the street is handsome from its breadth,
situation, and buildings.

I went next to view Paris from the top of St. Jacques' steeple, esteemed
the highest in the town, from whence I had a full view of the whole city
and suburbs, both which, as I judge, are not so large as London: though
the dissimilitude of their several forms and situations, this being
round, London long,--renders it difficult to determine; but there is no
comparison between the buildings, palaces, and materials, this being
entirely of stone and more sumptuous, though I esteem our piazzas to
exceed theirs.

Hence I took a turn in St. Innocent's churchyard, where the story of the
devouring quality of the ground (consuming bodies in twenty-four hours),
the vast charnels of bones, tombs, pyramids, and sepulchers, took up much
of my time, together with the hieroglyphical characters of Nicholas
Flamel's philosophical work, who had founded this church, and divers
other charitable establishments, as he testifies in his book.

Here divers clerks get their livelihood by inditing letters for poor
maids and other ignorant people who come to them for advice, and to write
for them into the country, both to their sweethearts, parents, and
friends; every large gravestone serving for a table. Joining to this
church is a common fountain, with good relievos upon it.

The next day I was carried to see a French gentleman's curious
collection, which abounded in fair and rich jewels of all sorts of
precious stones, most of them of great sizes and value; agates and
onyxes, some of them admirably colored and antique; nor inferior were his
landscapes from the best hands, most of which he had caused to be copied
in miniature; one of which, rarely painted on stone, was broken by one of
our company, by the mischance of setting it up: but such was the temper
and civility of the gentleman, that it altered nothing of his free and
noble humor.

The next morning, I was had by a friend to the garden of Monsieur Morine,
who, from being an ordinary gardener, is become one of the most skillful
and curious persons in France for his rare collection of shells, flowers,
and insects.

His garden is of an exact oval figure, planted with cypress, cut flat and
set as even as a wall: the tulips, anemones, ranunculuses, crocuses,
etc., are held to be of the rarest, and draw all the admirers of that
kind to his house during the season. He lived in a kind of hermitage at
one side of his garden, where his collection of porcelain and coral,
whereof one is carved into a large crucifix, is much esteemed. He has
also books of prints, by Albert [Durer], Van Leyden, Callot, etc. His
collection of all sorts of insects, especially of butterflies, is most
curious; these he spreads and so medicates, that no corruption invading
them, he keeps them in drawers, so placed as to represent a beautiful
piece of tapestry.

He showed me the remarks he had made on their propagation, which he
promised to publish. Some of these, as also of his best flowers, he had
caused to be painted in miniature by rare hands, and some in oil.

6th April, 1644. I sent my sister my own picture in water colors,[18]
which she requested of me, and went to see divers of the fairest palaces
of the town, as that of Vendôme, very large and stately; Lougueville;
Guise; Condé; Chevereuse; Nevers, esteemed one of the best in Paris
toward the river.

    [Footnote 18: In the first and second editions of the "Diary" many
    trifling personal details, such as this mention of the author having
    sent his own picture in water colors to his sister, were omitted. It
    is not necessary to point them out in detail. They are always of
    this personal character; as, among other examples, the mention of
    the wet weather preventing the diarist from stirring out, and that
    of his coming weary to his lodgings.]

I often went to the Palais Cardinal, bequeathed by Richelieu to the King,
on condition that it should be called by his name; at this time, the King
resided in it, because of the building of the Louvre. It is a very noble
house, though somewhat low; the galleries, paintings of the most
illustrious persons of both sexes, the Queen's baths, presence-chamber
with its rich carved and gilded roof, theater, and large garden, in which
is an ample fountain, grove, and mall, worthy of remark. Here I also
frequently went to see them ride and exercise the great horse, especially
at the Academy of Monsieur du Plessis, and de Veau, whose schools of that
art are frequented by the nobility; and here also young gentlemen are
taught to fence, dance, play on music, and something in fortification and
the mathematics. The design is admirable, some keeping near a hundred
brave horses, all managed to the great saddle.

12th April, 1644. I took coach, to see a general muster of all the _gens
d'armes_ about the city, in the Bois de Boulogne, before their Majesties
and all the Grandees. They were reputed to be near 20,000, besides the
spectators, who much exceeded them in number. Here they performed all
their motions; and, being drawn up, horse and foot, into several figures,
represented a battle.

[Sidenote: ORLEANS]

The summer now drawing near, I determined to spend the rest of it in some
more remote town on the river Loire; and, on 19th of April, I took leave
of Paris, and, by the way of the messenger, agreed for my passage to
Orleans.

The way from Paris to this city, as indeed most of the roads in France,
is paved with a small square freestone, so that the country does not much
molest the traveler with dirt and ill way, as in England, only 'tis
somewhat hard to the poor horses' feet, which causes them to ride more
temperately, seldom going out of the trot, or _grand pas_, as they call
it. We passed divers walled towns, or villages; among others of note,
Chartres and Etampes, where we lay the first night. This has a fair
church. The next day, we had an excellent road; but had liked to come
short home: for no sooner were we entered two or three leagues into the
Forest of Orleans (which extends itself many miles), but the company
behind us were set on by rogues, who, shooting from the hedges and
frequent covert, slew four upon the spot. Among the slain was a captain
of Swiss, of the regiment of Picardy, a person much lamented. This
disaster made such an alarm in Orleans at our arrival, that the Prevôt
Marshal, with his assistants, going in pursuit, brought in two whom they
had shot, and exposed them in the great market place, to see if any would
take cognizance of them. I had great cause to give God thanks for this
escape; when coming to Orleans and lying at the White Cross, I found Mr.
John Nicholas, eldest son to Mr. Secretary. In the night a cat kittened
on my bed, and left on it a young one having six ears, eight legs, two
bodies from the middle downward, and two tails. I found it dead, but
warm, in the morning when I awaked.

21st April, 1644. I went about to view the city, which is well built of
stone, on the side of the Loire. About the middle of the river is an
island, full of walks and fair trees, with some houses. This is
contiguous to the town by a stately stone bridge, reaching to the
opposite suburbs, built likewise on the edge of a hill, from whence is a
beautiful prospect. At one of the extremes of the bridge are strong
towers, and about the middle, on one side, is the statue of the Virgin
Mary, or Pieta, with the dead Christ in her lap, as big as the life. At
one side of the cross, kneels Charles VII., armed, and at the other Joan
d'Arc, armed also like a cavalier, with boots and spurs, her hair
disheveled, as the deliveress of the town from our countrymen, when they
besieged it. The figures are all cast in copper, with a pedestal full of
inscriptions, as well as a fair column joining it, which is all adorned
with fleurs-de-lis and a crucifix, with two saints proceeding (as it
were) from two branches out of its capital. The inscriptions on the cross
are in Latin: "_Mors Christi in cruce nos á contagione, labis et
æternorum morborum sanavit_." On the pedestal: "_Rex in hoc signo hostes
profligavit, et Johanna Virgo Aureliam obsidio liberavit. Non diu ab
impiis diruta, restituta sunt hoc anno D'ni 1578. Jean Buret, m.
f._"--"_Octannoque Galliam servitute Britannicâ liberavit. A Domino factum
est illud, et est mirabile in oculis nostris; in quorum memorià hæc
nostræ fidei Insignia_." To this is made an annual procession on 12th of
May, mass being sung before it, attended with great ceremony and
concourse of people. The wine of this place is so strong, that the King's
cup bearers are, as I was assured, sworn never to give the King any of
it: but it is a very noble liquor, and much of it transported into other
countries. The town is much frequented by strangers, especially Germans,
for the great purity of the language here spoken, as well as for divers
other privileges, and the University, which causes the English to make no
long sojourn here, except such as can drink and debauch. The city stands
in the county of Bealse (Blaisois); was once styled a Kingdom, afterward
a Duchy, as at present, belonging to the second son of France. Many
Councils have been held here, and some Kings crowned. The University is
very ancient, divided now by the students into that of four nations,
French, High Dutch, Normans, and Picardines, who have each their
respective protectors, several officers, treasurers, consuls, seals, etc.
There are in it two reasonable fair public libraries, whence one may
borrow a book to one's chamber, giving but a note under hand, which is an
extraordinary custom, and a confidence that has cost many libraries dear.
The first church I went to visit was St. Croix; it has been a stately
fabric, but now much ruined by the late civil wars. They report the tower
of it to have been the highest in France. There is the beginning of a
fair reparation. About this cathedral there is a very spacious cemetery.
The townhouse is also very nobly built, with a high tower to it. The
market place and streets, some whereof are deliciously planted with
limes, are ample and straight, so well paved with a kind of pebble, that
I have not seen a neater town in France. In fine, this city was by
Francis I. esteemed the most agreeable of his vast dominions.

28th April, 1644. Taking boat on the Loire, I went toward Blois, the
passage and river being both very pleasant. Passing Mehun, we dined at
Baugenci, and slept at a little town called St. Dieu. Quitting our bark,
we hired horses to Blois, by the way of Chambord, a famous house of the
King's, built by Francis I. in the middle of a solitary park, full of
deer, inclosed with a wall. I was particularly desirous of seeing this
palace, from the extravagance of the design, especially the staircase,
mentioned by Palladio. It is said that 1800 workmen were constantly
employed in this fabric for twelve years: if so, it is wonderful that it
was not finished, it being no greater than divers gentlemen's houses in
England, both for room and circuit. The carvings are indeed very rich and
full. The staircase is devised with four entries, or assents, which cross
one another, so that though four persons meet, they never come in sight,
but by small loopholes, till they land. It consists of 274 steps (as I
remember), and is an extraordinary work, but of far greater expense than
use or beauty. The chimneys of the house appear like so many towers.
About the whole is a large deep moat. The country about is full of corn,
and wine, with many fair noblemen's houses.

[Sidenote: BLOIS]

We arrived at Blois in the evening. The town is hilly, uneven, and
rugged, standing on the side of the Loire, having suburbs joined by a
stately stone bridge, on which is a pyramid with an inscription. At the
entrance of the castle is a stone statue of Louis XII. on horseback, as
large as life, under a Gothic state; and a little below are these words:

    "Hic ubi natus erat dextro Ludovicus Olympo,
      Sumpsit honoratâ regia sceptra manu;
    Felix quæ tanti fulsit Lux nuncia Regis!
      Gallica non alio principe digna fuit."

Under this is a very wide pair of gates, nailed full of wolves and
wild-boars' heads. Behind the castle the present Duke Gaston had begun a
fair building, through which we walked into a large garden, esteemed for
its furniture one of the fairest, especially for simples and exotic
plants, in which he takes extraordinary delight. On the right hand is a
long gallery full of ancient statues and inscriptions, both of marble and
brass; the length, 300 paces, divides the garden into higher and lower
ground, having a very noble fountain. There is the portrait of a hart,
taken in the forest by Louis XII., which has twenty-four antlers on its
head. In the Collegiate Church of St. Savior, we saw many sepulchres of
the Earls of Blois.

On Sunday, being May-day, we walked up into Pall Mall, very long, and so
noble shaded with tall trees (being in the midst of a great wood), that
unless that of Tours, I had not seen a statelier.

From hence, we proceeded with a friend of mine through the adjoining
forest, to see if we could meet any wolves, which are here in such
numbers that they often come and take children out of the very streets;
yet will not the Duke, who is sovereign here, permit them to be
destroyed. We walked five or six miles outright; but met with none; yet a
gentleman, who was resting himself under a tree, with his horse grazing
by him, told us that half an hour before, two wolves had set upon his
horse, and had in probability devoured him, but for a dog which lay by
him. At a little village at the end of this wood, we ate excellent cream,
and visited a castle builded on a very steep cliff.

Blois is a town where the language is exactly spoken; the inhabitants
very courteous; the air so good, that it is the ordinary nursery of the
King's children. The people are so ingenious, that, for goldsmith's work
and watches, no place in France affords the like. The pastures by the
river are very rich and pleasant.

2d May, 1644. We took boat again, passing by Charmont, a proud castle on
the left hand; before it is a sweet island, deliciously shaded with tall
trees. A little distance from hence, we went on shore at Amboise, a very
agreeable village, built of stone, and the houses covered with blue
slate, as the towns on the Loire generally are; but the castle chiefly
invited us, the thickness of whose towers from the river to the top, was
admirable. We entered by the drawbridge, which has an invention to let
one fall, if not premonished. It is full of halls and spacious chambers,
and one staircase is large enough, and sufficiently commodious, to
receive a coach, and land it on the very tower, as they told us had been
done. There is some artillery in it; but that which is most observable is
in the ancient chapel, viz, a stag's head, or branches, hung up by
chains, consisting of twenty browantlers, the beam bigger than a man's
middle, and of an incredible length. Indeed, it is monstrous, and yet I
cannot conceive how it should be artificial they show also the ribs and
vertebræ of the same beast; but these might be made of whalebone.

Leaving the castle, we passed Mont Louis, a village having no houses
above ground but such only as are hewn out of the main rocks of excellent
freestone. Here and there the funnel of a chimney appears on the surface
among the vineyards which are over them, and in this manner they inhabit
the caves, as it were sea-cliffs, on one side of the river for many
miles.

[Sidenote: TOURS]

We now came within sight of Tours, where we were designed for the rest of
the time I had resolved to stay in France, the sojournment being so
agreeable. Tours is situate on the east side of a hill on the river
Loire, having a fair bridge of stone called St. Edme; the streets are
very long, straight, spacious, well built, and exceeding clean; the
suburbs large and pleasant, joined to the city by another bridge. Both
the church and monastery of St. Martin are large, of Gothic building,
having four square towers, fair organs, and a stately altar, where they
show the bones and ashes of St. Martin, with other relics. The Mall
without comparison is the noblest in Europe for length and shade, having
seven rows of the tallest and goodliest elms I had ever beheld, the
innermost of which do so embrace each other, and at such a height, that
nothing can be more solemn and majestical. Here we played a party, or
party or two, and then walked about the town walls, built of square
stone, filled with earth, and having a moat. No city in France exceeds it
in beauty, or delight.

6th May, 1644. We went to St. Gatian, reported to have been built by our
countrymen; the dial and clockwork are much esteemed. The church has two
handsome towers and spires of stone, and the whole fabric is very noble
and venerable. To this joins the palace of the Archbishop, consisting
both of old and new building, with many fair rooms, and a fair garden.
Here I grew acquainted with one Monsieur Merey, a very good musician. The
Archbishop treated me very courteously. We visited divers other churches,
chapels, and monasteries for the most part neatly built, and full of
pretty paintings, especially the Convent of the Capuchins, which has a
prospect over the whole city, and many fair walks.

8th May, 1644. I went to see their manufactures in silk (for in this town
they drive a very considerable trade with silk-worms), their pressing and
watering the grograms and camlets, with weights of an extraordinary
poise, put into a rolling engine. Here I took a master of the language,
and studied the tongue very diligently, recreating myself sometimes at
the Mall, and sometimes about the town. The house opposite my lodging had
been formerly a King's palace; the outside was totally covered with
fleur-de-lis, embossed out of the stone. Here Mary de Medicis held her
Court, when she was compelled to retire from Paris by the persecution of
the great Cardinal.

25th May, 1644. Was the Fête Dieu, and a goodly procession of all the
religious orders, the whole streets hung with their best tapestries, and
their most precious movables exposed; silks, damasks, velvets, plate, and
pictures in abundance; the streets strewed with flowers, and full of
pageantry, banners, and bravery.

6th June, 1644. I went by water to visit that goodly and venerable Abbey
of Marmoutiers, being one of the greatest in the kingdom; to it is a very
ample church of stone, with a very high pyramid. Among other relics the
Monks showed us is the Holy Ampoulle, the same with that which sacres
their Kings at Rheims, this being the one that anointed Henry IV.
Ascending many steps, we went into the Abbot's Palace, where we were
showed a vast tun (as big as that at Heidelberg), which they report St.
Martin (as I remember) filled from one cluster of grapes growing there.

7th June, 1644. We walked about two miles from the city to an agreeable
solitude, called Du Plessis, a house belonging to the King. It has many
pretty gardens, full of nightingales; and, in the chapel, lies buried the
famous poet, Ronsard.

Returning, we stepped into a Convent of Franciscans, called St. Cosmo,
where the cloister is painted with the miracles of their St. Francis à
Paula, whose ashes lie in their chapel, with this inscription: "_Corpus
Sancti Fran. à Paula 1507, 13 Aprilis, concrematur verò ab Hæreticis anno
1562, cujus quidem ossa et cineres hìc jacent_." The tomb has four small
pyramids of marble at each corner.

9th June, 1644. I was invited to a vineyard, which was so artificially
planted and supported with arched poles, that stooping down one might see
from end to end, a very great length, under the vines, the bunches
hanging down in abundance.

20th June, 1644. We took horse to see certain natural caves, called
Gouttière, near Colombière, where there is a spring within the bowels of
the earth, very deep and so excessive cold, that the drops meeting with
some lapidescent matter, it converts them into a hard stone, which hangs
about it like icicles, having many others in the form of comfitures and
sugar plums, as we call them.

Near this, we went under the ground almost two furlongs, lighted with
candles, to see the source and spring which serves the whole city, by a
passage cut through the main rock of freestone.

28th June, 1644. I went to see the palace and gardens of Chevereux, a
sweet place.

30th June, 1644. I walked through the vineyards as far as Roche Corbé, to
the ruins of an old and very strong castle, said to have been built by
the English, of great height, on the precipice of a dreadful cliff, from
whence the country and river yield a most incomparable prospect.

27th July, 1644. I heard excellent music at the Jesuits, who have here a
school and convent, but a mean chapel. We have now store of those
admirable melons, so much celebrated in France for the best in the
kingdom.

1st August, 1644. My valet, one Garro, a Spaniard, born in Biscao, having
misbehaved, I was forced to discharge him; he demanded of me (besides his
wages) no less than 100 crowns to carry him to his country; refusing to
pay it, as no part of our agreement, he had the impudence to arrest me;
the next day I was to appear in Court, where both our avocats pleaded
before the Lieutenant Civil; but it was so unreasonable a pretense, that
the Judge had not patience to hear it out. The Judge immediately
acquitted me, after he had reproached the avocat who took part with my
servant, he rose from the Bench, and making a courteous excuse to me,
that being a stranger I should be so used, he conducted me through the
court to the street-door. This varlet afterward threatened to pistol me.
The next day, I waited on the Lieutenant, to thank him for his great
civility.

18th August, 1644. The Queen of England came to Tours, having newly
arrived in France, and going for Paris. She was very nobly received by
the people and clergy, who went to meet her with the trained bands.
After the harangue, the Archbishop entertained her at his Palace, where I
paid my duty to her. The 20th she set forward to Paris.

8th September, 1644. Two of my kinsmen came from Paris to this place,
where I settled them in their pension and exercises.

14th September, 1644. We took post for Richelieu, passing by l'Isle
Bouchard, a village in the way. The next day, we arrived, and went to see
the Cardinal's Palace, near it. The town is built in a low, marshy
ground, having a narrow river cut by hand, very even and straight,
capable of bringing up a small vessel. It consists of only one
considerable street, the houses on both sides (as indeed throughout the
town) built exactly uniform, after a modern handsome design. It has a
large goodly market house and place, opposite to which is the church
built of freestone, having two pyramids of stone, which stand hollow from
the towers. The church is well built, and of a well-ordered architecture,
within handsomely paved and adorned. To this place belongs an Academy,
where, besides the exercise of the horse, arms, dancing, etc., all the
sciences are taught in the vulgar French by professors stipendiated by
the great Cardinal, who by this, the cheap living there, and divers
privileges, not only designed the improvement of the vulgar language, but
to draw people and strangers to the town; but since the Cardinal's death,
it is thinly inhabited; standing so much out of the way, and in a place
not well situated for health, or pleasure. He was allured to build by the
name of the place, and an old house there belonging to his ancestors.
This pretty town is handsomely walled about and moated, with a kind of
slight fortification, two fair gates and drawbridges. Before the gate,
toward the palace, is a spacious circle, where the fair is annually kept.
About a flight-shot from the town is the Cardinal's house, a princely
pile, though on an old design, not altogether Gothic, but mixed, and
environed by a clear moat. The rooms are stately, most richly furnished
with tissue, damask, arras, and velvet, pictures, statues, vases, and all
sorts of antiquities, especially the Cæsars, in oriental alabaster. The
long gallery is painted with the famous acts of the Founder; the roof
with the life of Julius Cæsar; at the end of it is a cupola, or singing
theatre, supported by very stately pillars of black marble. The chapel
anciently belonged to the family of the Founder. The court is very ample.
The gardens without are very large, and the parterres of excellent
embroidery, set with many statues of brass and marble; the groves,
meadows, and walks are a real Paradise.

16th September, 1644. We returned to Tours, from whence, after nineteen
weeks' sojourn, we traveled toward the more southern part of France,
minding now to shape my course so, as I might winter in Italy. With my
friend, Mr. Thicknesse, and our guide, we went the first day seven
leagues to a castle called Chenonceau, built by Catherine de Medicis, and
now belonging to the Duke de Vendôme, standing on a bridge. In the
gallery, among divers other excellent statues, is that of Scipio
Africanus, of oriental alabaster.

[Sidenote: BOURGES]

21st September, 1644. We passed by Villefranche, where we dined, and so
by Muneton, lying at Viaron-au-mouton, which was twenty leagues. The next
day by Murg to Bourges, four leagues, where we spent the day. This is the
capital of Berry, an University much frequented by the Dutch, situated on
the river Eure. It stands high, is strong, and well placed for defense;
is environed with meadows and vines, and the living here is very cheap.
In the suburbs of St. Privé, there is a fountain of sharp water which
they report wholesome against the stone. They showed us a vast tree which
they say stands in the center of France. The French tongue is spoken with
great purity in this place. St. Stephen's church is the cathedral, well
built _à la Gothique_, full of sepulchres without-side, with the
representation of the final Judgment over one of the ports. Here they
show the chapel of Claude de la Chastre, a famous soldier who had served
six kings of France in their wars. St. Chapelle is built much like that
at Paris, full of relics, and containing the bones of one Briat, a giant
of fifteen cubits high. It was erected by John, Duke of Berry, and there
is showed the coronet of the dukedom. The great tower is a Pharos for
defense of the town, very strong, in thickness eighteen feet, fortified
with graffs and works; there is a garrison in it, and a strange engine
for throwing great stones, and the iron cage where Louis, Duke of
Orleans, was kept by Charles VIII. Near the Town-house stands the College
of Jesuits, where was heretofore an Amphitheater. I was courteously
entertained by a Jesuit, who had us into the garden, where we fell into
disputation. The house of Jaques Coeur is worth seeing. Bourges is an
Archbishopric and Primacy of Aquitaine. I took my leave of Mr. Nicholas,
and some other English there; and, on the 23d, proceeded on my journey by
Pont du Charge; and lay that evening at Coulaiure, thirteen leagues.

24th September, 1644. By Franchesse, St. Menoux, thence to Moulins, where
we dined. This is the chief town of the Bourbonnois, on the river Allier,
very navigable. The streets are fair; the castle has a noble prospect,
and has been the seat of the Dukes. Here is a pretty park and garden.
After dinner, came many who offered knives and scissors to sell; it being
a town famous for these trifles. This Duchy of Bourbon is ordinarily
assigned for the dowry of the Queens of France.

Hence, we took horse for Varennes, an obscure village, where we lay that
night. The next day, we went somewhat out of the way to see the town of
Bourbon l'Archambaut, from whose ancient and rugged castle is derived the
name of the present Royal Family of France. The castle stands on a flinty
rock, overlooking the town. In the midst of the streets are some baths of
medicinal waters, some of them excessive hot, but nothing so neatly
walled and adorned as ours in Somersetshire; and indeed they are chiefly
used to drink of, our Queen being then lodged there for that purpose.
After dinner, I went to see the St. Chapelle, a prime place of devotion,
where is kept one of the thorns of our Savior's crown, and a piece of the
real cross; excellent paintings on glass, and some few statues of stone
and wood, which they show for curiosities. Hence, we went forward to La
Palise, a village that lodged us that night.

26th September, 1644. We arrived at Roane, where we quitted our guide,
and took post for Lyons. Roane seemed to me one of the pleasantest and
most agreeable places imaginable, for a retired person: for, besides the
situation on the Loire, there are excellent provisions cheap and
abundant. It being late when we left this town, we rode no further than
Tarare that night (passing St. Saforin), a little desolate village in a
valley near a pleasant stream, encompassed with fresh meadows and
vineyards. The hills which we rode over before we descended, and
afterward, on the Lyons side of this place, are high and mountainous; fir
and pines growing frequently on them. The air methought was much altered
as well as the manner of the houses, which are built flatter, more after
the eastern manner. Before I went to bed, I took a landscape of this
pleasant terrace. There followed a most violent tempest of thunder and
lightning.

[Sidenote: LYONS]

27th September, 1644. We rode by Pont Charu to Lyons, which being but six
leagues we soon accomplished, having made eighty-five leagues from Tours
in seven days. Here at the Golden Lion, rue de Flandre, I met divers of
my acquaintance, who, coming from Paris, were designed for Italy. We lost
no time in seeing the city, because of being ready to accompany these
gentlemen in their journey. Lyons is excellently situated on the
confluence of the rivers Soane and Rhone, which wash the walls of the
city in a very rapid stream; each of these has its bridge; that over the
Rhone consists of twenty-eight arches. The two high cliffs, called St.
Just and St. Sebastian, are very stately; on one of them stands a strong
fort, garrisoned. We visited the cathedral, St. Jean, where was one of
the fairest clocks for art and busy invention I had ever seen. The fabric
of the church is gothic, as are likewise those of St. Etienne and St.
Croix. From the top of one of the towers of St. Jean (for it has four) we
beheld the whole city and country, with a prospect reaching to the Alps,
many leagues distant. The Archbishop's palace is fairly built. The church
of St. Nisier is the greatest; that of the Jacobins is well built. Here
are divers other fine churches and very noble buildings we had not time
to visit, only that of the Charité, or great hospital for poor, infirm
people, entertaining about 1,500 souls, with a school, granary, gardens,
and all conveniences, maintained at a wonderful expense, worthy seeing.
The place of the _Belle Cour_ is very spacious, observable for the view
it affords, so various and agreeable, of hills, rocks, vineyards,
gardens, precipices, and other extravagant and incomparable advantages
presenting themselves together. The Pall Mall is set with fair trees. In
fine, this stately, clean, and noble city, built all of stone, abounds
in persons of quality and rich merchants: those of Florence obtaining
great privileges above the rest. In the Town-house, they show two tables
of brass, on which is engraven Claudius's speech, pronounced to the
Senate, concerning the franchising of the town, with the Roman
privileges. There are also other antiquities.

30th September, 1644. We bargained with a waterman to carry us to Avignon
on the river, and got the first night to Vienne, in Dauphiné. This is an
Archbishopric, and the province gives title to the heir-apparent of
France. Here we supped and lay, having among other dainties, a dish of
truffles, which is a certain earth-nut, found out by a hog trained to it,
and for which those animals are sold at a great price. It is in truth an
incomparable meat. We were shown the ruins of an amphitheatre, pretty
entire; and many handsome palaces, especially that of Pontius Pilate, not
far from the town, at the foot of a solitary mountain, near the river,
having four pinnacles. Here it is reported he passed his exile, and
precipitated himself into the lake not far from it. The house is modern,
and seems to be the seat of some gentleman; being in a very pleasant,
though melancholy place. The cathedral of Vienne is St. Maurice; and
there are many other pretty buildings, but nothing more so, than the
mills where they hammer and polish the sword blades.

Hence, the next morning we swam (for the river here is so rapid that the
boat was only steered) to a small village called Thein, where we dined.
Over against this is another town, named Tournon, where is a very strong
castle under a high precipice. To the castle joins the Jesuits' College,
who have a fair library. The prospect was so tempting, that I could not
forbear designing it with my crayon.

We then came to Valence, a capital city carrying the title of a Duchy;
but the Bishop is now sole Lord temporal of it, and the country about it.
The town having a University famous for the study of the civil law, is
much frequented; but the churches are none of the fairest, having been
greatly defaced in the time of the wars. The streets are full of pretty
fountains. The citadel is strong and garrisoned. Here we passed the
night, and the next morning by Pont St. Esprit, which consists of
twenty-two arches; in the piers of the arches are windows, as it were, to
receive the water when it is high and full. Here we went on shore, it
being very dangerous to pass the bridge in a boat.

[Sidenote: AVIGNON]

Hence, leaving our barge, we took horse, seeing at a distance the town
and principality of Orange; and, lodging one night on the way, we arrived
at noon at Avignon. This town has belonged to the Popes ever since the
time of Clement V.; being, in 1352, alienated by Jane, Queen of Naples
and Sicily. Entering the gates, the soldiers at the guard took our
pistols and carbines, and examined us very strictly; after that, having
obtained the Governor's and the Vice-Legate's leave to tarry three days,
we were civilly conducted to our lodging. The city is on the Rhone, and
divided from the newer part, or town, which is on the other side of the
river, by a very fair stone bridge (which has been broken); at one end is
a very high rock, on which is a strong castle well furnished with
artillery. The walls of the city are of large, square freestone, the most
neat and best in repair I ever saw. It is full of well-built palaces;
those of the Vice-Legate and Archbishop being the most magnificent. There
are many sumptuous churches, especially that of St. Magdalene and St.
Martial, wherein the tomb of the Cardinal d'Amboise is the most
observable. Clement VI. lies buried in that of the Celestines, the altar
whereof is exceedingly rich: but for nothing I more admired it than the
tomb of Madonna Laura, the celebrated mistress of Petrarch. We saw the
Arsenal, the Pope's palace, and the Synagogue of the Jews, who here are
distinguished by their red hats. Vaucluse, so much renowned for the
solitude of Petrarch, we beheld from the castle; but could not go to
visit it for want of time, being now taking mules and a guide for
Marseilles.

We lay at Loumas; the next morning, came to Aix, having passed that
extremely rapid and dangerous river of Durance. In this tract, all the
heaths, or commons, are covered with rosemary, lavender, lentiscus, and
the like sweet shrubs, for many miles together; which to me was very
pleasant. Aix is the chief city of Provence, being a Parliament and
Presidential town, with other royal Courts and Metropolitan jurisdiction.
It is well built, the houses very high, and the streets ample. The
Cathedral, St. Savior's, is a noble pile adorned with innumerable
figures; especially that of St. Michael; the Baptisterie, the Palace, the
Court, built in a most spacious piazza, are very fair. The Duke of
Guise's house is worth seeing, being furnished with many antiquities in
and about it. The Jesuits have here a royal College, and the City is a
University.

7th October, 1644. We had a most delicious journey to Marseilles, through
a country sweetly declining to the south and Mediterranean coasts, full
of vineyards and olive-yards, orange trees, myrtles, pomegranates, and
the like sweet plantations, to which belong pleasantly-situated villas to
the number of above 1,500, built all of freestone, and in prospect
showing as if they were so many heaps of snow dropped out of the clouds
among those perennial greens. It was almost at the shutting of the gates
that we arrived. Marseilles is on the sea-coast, on a pleasant rising
ground, well walled, with an excellent port for ships and galleys,
secured by a huge chain of iron drawn across the harbor at pleasure; and
there is a well-fortified tower with three other forts, especially that
built on a rock; but the castle commanding the city is that of Notre Dame
de la Garde. In the chapel hung up are divers crocodiles' skins.

We went then to visit the galleys, being about twenty-five in number; the
Capitaine of the Galley Royal gave us most courteous entertainment in his
cabin, the slaves in the interim playing both loud and soft music very
rarely. Then he showed us how he commanded their motions with a nod, and
his whistle making them row out. The spectacle was to me new and strange,
to see so many hundreds of miserably naked persons, their heads being
shaven close, and having only high red bonnets, a pair of coarse canvas
drawers, their whole backs and legs naked, doubly chained about their
middle and legs, in couples, and made fast to their seats, and all
commanded in a trice by an imperious and cruel seaman. One Turk among the
rest he much favored, who waited on him in his cabin, but with no other
dress than the rest, and a chain locked about his leg, but not coupled.
This galley was richly carved and gilded, and most of the rest were very
beautiful. After bestowing something on the slaves, the capitaine sent a
band of them to give us music at dinner where we lodged. I was amazed to
contemplate how these miserable caitiffs lie in their galley crowded
together; yet there was hardly one but had some occupation, by which, as
leisure and calms permitted, they got some little money, insomuch as some
of them have, after many years of cruel servitude, been able to purchase
their liberty. The rising-forward and falling-back at their oar, is a
miserable spectacle, and the noise of their chains, with the roaring of
the beaten waters, has something of strange and fearful in it to one
unaccustomed to it. They are ruled and chastised by strokes on their
backs and soles of their feet, on the least disorder, and without the
least humanity, yet are they cheerful and full of knavery.

After dinner, we saw the church of St. Victoire, where is that saint's
head in a shrine of silver, which weighs 600 pounds. Thence to Notre
Dame, exceedingly well built, which is the cathedral. Thence to the Duke
of Guise's Palace, the Palace of Justice, and the Maison du Roi; but
nothing is more strange than the great number of slaves working in the
streets, and carrying burdens, with their confused noises, and jingling
of their huge chains. The chief trade of the town is in silks and drugs
out of Africa, Syria, and Egypt, and Barbary horses, which are brought
hither in great numbers. The town is governed by four captains, has three
consuls, and one assessor, three judges royal; the merchants have a judge
for ordinary causes. Here we bought umbrellas against the heats, and
consulted of our journey to Cannes by land, for fear of the Picaroon
Turks, who make prize of any small vessels about these parts; we not
finding a galley bound for Genoa, whither we were designed.

[Sidenote: PERIGUEUX]

9th October, 1644. We took mules, passing the first night very late in
sight of St. Baume, and the solitary grot where they affirmed Mary
Magdalen did her penance. The next day, we lay at Perigueux, a city built
on an old foundation; witness the ruins of a most stately amphitheatre,
which I went out to design, being about a flight-shot from the town; they
call it now the Rolsies. There is also a strong tower near the town,
called the Visone, but the town and city are at some distance from each
other. It is a bishopric; has a cathedral with divers noblemen's houses
in sight of the sea. The place was formerly called Forum Julij, well
known by antiquaries.

10th October, 1644. We proceeded by the ruins of a stately aqueduct. The
soil about the country is rocky, full of pines and rare simples.

11th October, 1644. We lay at Cannes, which is a small port on the
Mediterranean; here we agreed with a seaman to carry us to Genoa, and,
having procured a bill of health (without which there is no admission at
any town in Italy), we embarked on the 12th. We touched at the islands of
St. Margaret and St. Honore, lately retaken from the Spaniards with great
bravery by Prince Harcourt. Here, having paid some small duty, we bought
some trifles offered us by the soldiers, but without going on shore.
Hence, we coasted within two leagues of Antibes, which is the utmost town
in France. Thence by Nice, a city in Savoy, built all of brick, which
gives it a very pleasant appearance toward the sea, having a very high
castle which commands it. We sailed by Morgus, now called Monaco, having
passed Villa Franca, heretofore Portus Herculis, when, arriving after the
gates were shut, we were forced to abide all night in the barge, which
was put into the haven, the wind coming contrary. In the morning, we were
hastened away, having no time permitted us by our avaricious master to go
up and see this strong and considerable place, which now belongs to a
prince of the family of Grimaldi, of Genoa, who has put both it and
himself under the protection of the French. The situation is on a
promontory of solid stone and rock. The town walls very fair. We were
told that within it was an ample court, and a palace, furnished with the
most rich and princely movables, and a collection of statues, pictures,
and massy plate to an immense amount.

[Sidenote: SAVONA]

We sailed by Menton and Ventimiglia, being the first city of the republic
of Genoa; supped at Oneglia, where we anchored and lay on shore. The next
morning, we coasted in view of the Isle of Corsica, and St. Remo, where
the shore is furnished with evergreens, oranges, citrons, and date trees;
we lay at Port Mauritio. The next morning by Diano, Araisso, famous for
the best coral fishing, growing in abundance on the rocks, deep and
continually covered by the sea. By Albenga and Finale, a very fair and
strong town belonging to the King of Spain, for which reason a monsieur
in our vessel was extremely afraid, as was the patron of our bark, for
they frequently catch French prizes as they creep by these shores to go
into Italy; he therefore plied both sails and oars, to get under the
protection of a Genoese galley that passed not far before us, and in
whose company we sailed as far as the Cape of Savona, a town built at the
rise of the Apennines: for all this coast (except a little of St. Remo)
is a high and steep mountainous ground, consisting all of rock-marble,
without any grass, tree, or rivage, formidable to look on. A strange
object it is, to consider how some poor cottages stand fast on the
declivities of these precipices, and by what steps the inhabitants ascend
to them. The rock consists of all sorts of the most precious marbles.

Here, on the 15th, forsaking our galley, we encountered a little foul
weather, which made us creep _terra, terra_, as they call it, and so a
vessel that encountered us advised us to do; but our patron, striving to
double the point of Savona, making out into the wind put us into great
hazard; for blowing very hard from land between those horrid gaps of the
mountains, it set so violently, as raised on the sudden so great a sea,
that we could not recover the weather-shore for many hours, insomuch
that, what with the water already entered, and the confusion of fearful
passengers (of which one was an Irish bishop, and his brother, a priest,
were confessing some as at the article of death), we were almost
abandoned to despair, our pilot himself giving us up for lost. And now,
as we were weary with pumping and laving out the water, almost sinking,
it pleased God on the sudden to appease the wind, and with much ado and
great peril we recovered the shore, which we now kept in view within half
a league in sight of those pleasant villas, and within scent of those
fragrant orchards which are on this coast, full of princely retirements
for the sumptuousness of their buildings, and nobleness of the
plantations, especially those at St. Pietro d'Arena; from whence, the
wind blowing as it did, might perfectly be smelt the peculiar joys of
Italy in the perfumes of orange, citron, and jasmine flowers, for divers
leagues seaward.[19]

    [Footnote 19: Evelyn seems to have been much enchanted by the
    fragrancy of the air of this coast, for he has noticed it again in
    his dedication of the "Fumifugium," to Charles the Second.]

[Sidenote: GENOA]

16th October, 1644. We got to anchor under the Pharos, or watch-tower,
built on a high rock at the mouth of the Mole of Genoa, the weather being
still so foul that for two hours at least we durst not stand into the
haven. Toward evening we adventured, and came on shore by the
Prattique-house, where, after strict examination by the Syndics, we were
had to the Ducal Palace, and there our names being taken, we were
conducted to our inn, kept by one Zacharias, an Englishman. I shall never
forget a story of our host Zachary, who, on the relation of our peril,
told us another of his own, being shipwrecked, as he affirmed solemnly,
in the middle of a great sea somewhere in the West Indies, that he swam
no less than twenty-two leagues to another island, with a tinderbox
wrapped up in his hair, which was not so much as wet all the way; that
picking up the carpenter's tools with other provisions in a chest, he and
the carpenter, who accompanied him (good swimmers it seems both), floated
the chest before them; and, arriving at last in a place full of wood,
they built another vessel, and so escaped! After this story, we no more
talked of our danger; Zachary put us quite down.

17th October, 1644. Accompanied by a most courteous marchand, called
Tomson, we went to view the rarities. The city is built in the hollow or
bosom of a mountain, whose ascent is very steep, high, and rocky, so
that, from the Lantern and Mole to the hill, it represents the shape of a
theater; the streets and buildings so ranged one above another, as our
seats are in the playhouses; but, from their materials, beauty, and
structure, never was an artificial scene more beautiful to the eye, nor
is any place, for the size of it, so full of well-designed and stately
palaces, as may be easily concluded by that rare book in a large folio
which the great virtuoso and painter, Paul Rubens, has published, though
it contains [the description of] only one street and two or three
churches.

The first palace we went to visit was that of Hieronymo del Negros, to
which we passed by boat across the harbor. Here I could not but observe
the sudden and devilish passion of a seaman, who plying us was
intercepted by another fellow, that interposed his boat before him and
took us in; for the tears gushing out of his eyes, he put his finger in
his mouth and almost bit it off by the joint, showing it to his
antagonist as an assurance to him of some bloody revenge, if ever he came
near that part of the harbor again. Indeed this beautiful city is more
stained with such horrid acts of revenge and murders, than any one place
in Europe, or haply in the world, where there is a political government,
which makes it unsafe to strangers. It is made a galley matter to carry a
knife whose point is not broken off.

This palace of Negros is richly furnished with the rarest pictures; on
the terrace, or hilly garden, there is a grove of stately trees, among
which are sheep, shepherds, and wild beasts, cut very artificially in a
gray stone; fountains, rocks, and fish ponds; casting your eyes one way,
you would imagine yourself in a wilderness and silent country; sideways,
in the heart of a great city; and backward, in the midst of the sea. All
this is within one acre of ground. In the house, I noticed those
red-plaster floors which are made so hard, and kept so polished, that for
some time one would take them for whole pieces of porphyry. I have
frequently wondered that we never practiced this [art] in England for
cabinets and rooms of state, for it appears to me beyond any invention of
that kind; but by their carefully covering them with canvass and fine
mattresses, where there is much passage, I suppose they are not lasting
there in glory, and haply they are often repaired.

There are numerous other palaces of particular curiosities, for the
marchands being very rich, have, like our neighbors, the Hollanders,
little or no extent of ground to employ their estates in; as those in
pictures and hangings, so these lay it out on marble houses and rich
furniture. One of the greatest here for circuit is that of the Prince
Doria, which reaches from the sea to the summit of the mountains. The
house is most magnificently built without, nor less gloriously furnished
within, having whole tables and bedsteads of massy silver, many of them
set with agates, onyxes, cornelians, lazulis, pearls, torquoises, and
other precious stones. The pictures and statues are innumerable. To this
palace belong three gardens, the first whereof is beautified with a
terrace, supported by pillars of marble; there is a fountain of eagles,
and one of Neptune, with other sea-gods, all of the purest white marble;
they stand in a most ample basin of the same stone. At the side of this
garden is such an aviary as Sir Francis Bacon describes in his "_Sermones
Fidelium_," or "Essays," wherein grow trees of more than two feet
diameter, besides cypress, myrtles, lentiscuses, and other rare shrubs,
which serve to nestle and perch all sorts of birds, who have air and
place enough under their airy canopy, supported with huge iron work,
stupendous for its fabric and the charge. The other two gardens are full
of orange trees, citrons, and pomegranates, fountains, grots, and
statues. One of the latter is a colossal Jupiter, under which is the
sepulchre of a beloved dog, for the care of which one of this family
received of the King of Spain 500 crowns a year, during the life of that
faithful animal. The reservoir of water here is a most admirable piece of
art; and so is the grotto over against it.

We went hence to the Palace of the Dukes, where is also the Court of
Justice; thence to the Merchant's Walk, rarely covered. Near the Ducal
Palace we saw the public armory, which was almost all new, most neatly
kept and ordered, sufficient for 30,000 men. We were showed many rare
inventions and engines of war peculiar to that armory, as in the state
when guns were first put in use. The garrison of the town chiefly
consists of Germans and Corsicans. The famous Strada Nova, built wholly
of polished marble, was designed by Rubens, and for stateliness of the
buildings, paving, and evenness of the street, is far superior to any in
Europe, for the number of houses; that of Don Carlo Doria is a most
magnificent structure. In the gardens of the old Marquis Spinola, I saw
huge citrons hanging on the trees, applied like our apricots to the
walls. The churches are no less splendid than the palaces; that of St.
Francis is wholly built of Parian marble; St. Laurence, in the middle of
the city, of white and black polished stone, the inside wholly incrusted
with marble and other precious materials; on the altar of St. John stand
four sumptuous columns of porphyry; and here we were showed an emerald,
supposed to be one of the largest in the world. The church of St.
Ambrosio, belonging to the Jesuits, will, when finished, exceed all the
rest; and that of the Annunciada, founded at the charges of one family,
in the present and future design can never be outdone for cost and art.
From the churches we walked to the Mole, a work of solid huge stone,
stretching itself near 600 paces into the main sea, and secures the
harbor, heretofore of no safety. Of all the wonders of Italy, for the art
and nature of the design, nothing parallels this. We passed over to the
Pharos, or Lantern, a tower of very great height. Here we took horses,
and made the circuit of the city as far as the new walls, built of a
prodigious height, and with Herculean industry; witness those vast pieces
of whole mountains which they have hewn away, and blown up with
gunpowder, to render them steep and inaccessible. They are not much less
than twenty English miles in extent, reaching beyond the utmost buildings
of the city. From one of these promontories we could easily discern the
island of Corsica; and from the same, eastward, we saw a vale having a
great torrent running through a most desolate barren country; and then
turning our eyes more northward, saw those delicious villas of St. Pietro
d'Arena, which present another Genoa to you, the ravishing retirements of
the Genoese nobility. Hence, with much pain, we descended toward the
Arsenal, where the galleys lie in excellent order.

The inhabitants of the city are much affected to the Spanish mode and
stately garb. From the narrowness of the streets, they use sedans and
litters, and not coaches.

19th October, 1644. We embarked in a felucca for Livorno, or Leghorn; but
the sea running very high, we put in at Porto Venere, which we made with
peril, between two narrow horrid rocks, against which the sea dashed with
great velocity; but we were soon delivered into as great a calm and a
most ample harbor, being in the Golfo di Spetia. From hence, we could see
Pliny's Delphini Promontorium, now called Capo fino. Here stood that
famous city of Luna, whence the port was named Lunaris, being about two
leagues over, more resembling a lake than a haven, but defended by
castles and excessive high mountains. We landed at Lerici, where, being
Sunday, was a great procession, carrying the Sacrament about the streets
in solemn devotion. After dinner we took post-horses, passing through
whole groves of olive trees, the way somewhat rugged and hilly at first,
but afterward pleasant. Thus we passed through the towns of Sarzana and
Massa, and the vast marble quarries of Carrara, and lodged in an obscure
inn, at a place called Viregio. The next morning we arrived at Pisa,
where I met my old friend, Mr. Thomas Henshaw, who was then newly come
out of Spain, and from whose company I never parted till more than a year
after.

The city of Pisa is as much worth seeing as any in Italy; it has
contended with Rome, Florence, Sardinia, Sicily, and even Carthage. The
palace and church of St. Stefano (where the order of knighthood called by
that name was instituted) drew first our curiosity, the outside thereof
being altogether of polished marble; within, it is full of tables
relating to this Order; over which hang divers banners and pendants, with
other trophies taken by them from the Turks, against whom they are
particularly obliged to fight; though a religious order, they are
permitted to marry. At the front of the palace stands a fountain, and the
statue of the great Duke Cosmo. The Campanile, or Settezonio, built by
John Venipont, a German, consists of several orders of pillars, thirty in
a row, designed to be much higher. It stands alone on the right side of
the cathedral, strangely remarkable for this, that the beholder would
expect it to fall, being built exceedingly declining, by a rare address
of the architect; and how it is supported from falling I think would
puzzle a good geometrician. The Duomo, or Cathedral, standing near it, is
a superb structure, beautified with six columns of great antiquity; the
gates are of brass, of admirable workmanship. The cemetery called Campo
Santo is made of divers galley ladings of earth formerly brought from
Jerusalem, said to be of such a nature, as to consume dead bodies in
forty hours. 'Tis cloistered with marble arches; and here lies buried the
learned Philip Decius, who taught in this University. At one side of this
church stands an ample and well-wrought marble vessel, which heretofore
contained the tribute paid yearly by the city to Cæsar. It is placed, as
I remember, on a pillar of opal stone, with divers other antique urns.
Near this, and in the same field, is the Baptistery of San Giovanni,
built of pure white marble, and covered with so artificial a cupola,
that the voice uttered under it seems to break out of a cloud. The font
and pulpit, supported by four lions, is of inestimable value for the
preciousness of the materials. The place where these buildings stand they
call the AREA. Hence, we went to the College, to which joins a gallery so
furnished with natural rarities, stones, minerals, shells, dried animals,
skeletons, etc., as is hardly to be seen in Italy. To this the Physic
Garden lies, where is a noble palm tree, and very fine waterworks. The
river Arno runs through the middle of this stately city, whence the main
street is named Lung 'Arno. It is so ample that the Duke's galleys, built
in the arsenal here, are easily conveyed to Livorno; over the river is an
arch, the like of which, for its flatness, and serving for a bridge, is
nowhere in Europe. The Duke has a stately Palace, before which is placed
the statue of Ferdinand the Third; over against it is the Exchange, built
of marble. Since this city came to be under the Dukes of Tuscany, it has
been much depopulated, though there is hardly in Italy any which exceeds
it for stately edifices. The situation of it is low and flat; but the
inhabitants have spacious gardens, and even fields within the walls.

[Sidenote: LIVORNO]

21st October, 1644. We took coach to Livorno, through the Great Duke's
new park full of huge cork trees, the underwood all myrtles, among which
were many buffaloes feeding, a kind of wild ox, short nose with horns
reversed; those who work with them command them, as our bearwards do the
bears, with a ring through the nose, and a cord. Much of this park, as
well as a great part of the country about it, is very fenny, and the air
very bad.

Leghorn is the prime port belonging to all the Duke's territories;
heretofore a very obscure town, but since Duke Ferdinand has strongly
fortified it (after the modern way), drained the marshes by cutting a
channel thence to Pisa navigable sixteen miles, and has raised a Mole,
emulating that at Genoa, to secure the shipping, it is become a place of
great receipt; it has also a place for the galleys, where they lie safe.
Before the sea is an ample piazza for the market, where are the statues
in copper of the four slaves, much exceeding the life for proportion,
and, in the judgment of most artists, one of the best pieces of modern
work. Here, especially in this piazza, is such a concourse of slaves,
Turks, Moors, and other nations, that the number and confusion is
prodigious; some buying, others selling, others drinking, others playing,
some working, others sleeping, fighting, singing, weeping, all nearly
naked, and miserably chained. Here was a tent, where any idle fellow
might stake his liberty against a few crowns, at dice, or other hazard;
and, if he lost, he was immediately chained and led away to the galleys,
where he was to serve a term of years, but from whence they seldom
returned; many sottish persons, in a drunken bravado, would try their
fortune in this way.

The houses of this neat town are very uniform, and excellently painted _á
fresco_ on the outer walls, with representations of many of their
victories over the Turks. The houses, though low on account of the
earthquakes which frequently happen here, (as did one during my being in
Italy), are very well built; the piazza is very fair and commodious, and,
with the church, whose four columns at the portico are of black marble
polished, gave the first hint to the building both of the church and
piazza in Covent Garden with us, though very imperfectly pursued.

[Sidenote: FLORENCE]

22d October, 1644. From Livorno, I took coach to Empoly, where we lay,
and the next day arrived at Florence, being recommended to the house of
Signor Baritiére, in the Piazza del Spirito Santo, where we were
exceedingly well treated. Florence is at the foot of the Apennines, the
west part full of stately groves and pleasant meadows, beautified with
more than a thousand houses and country palaces of note, belonging to
gentlemen of the town. The river Arno runs through the city, in a broad,
but very shallow channel, dividing it, as it were, in the middle, and
over it are four most sumptuous bridges of stone. On that nearest to our
quarter are the four Seasons, in white marble; on another are the
goldsmiths' shops; at the head of the former stands a column of ophite,
upon which a statue of Justice, with her balance and sword, cut out of
porphyry, and the more remarkable for being the first which had been
carved out of that hard material, and brought to perfection, after the
art had been utterly lost; they say this was done by hardening the tools
in the juice of certain herbs. This statue was erected in that corner,
because there Cosmo was first saluted with the news of Sienna being
taken.

Near this is the famous Palazzo di Strozzi, a princely piece of
architecture, in a rustic manner. The Palace of Pitti was built by that
family, but of late greatly beautified by Cosmo with huge square stones
of the Doric, Ionic, and the Corinthian orders, with a terrace at each
side having rustic uncut balustrades, with a fountain that ends in a
cascade seen from the great gate, and so forming a vista to the gardens.
Nothing is more admirable than the vacant staircase, marbles, statues,
urns, pictures, court, grotto, and waterworks. In the quadrangle is a
huge jetto of water in a volto of four faces, with noble statues at each
square, especially the Diana of porphyry above the grotto. We were here
shown a prodigious great loadstone.

The garden has every variety, hills, dales, rocks, groves, aviaries,
vivaries, fountains, especially one of five jettos, the middle basin
being one of the longest stones I ever saw. Here is everything to make
such a Paradise delightful. In the garden I saw a rose grafted on an
orange tree. There was much topiary-work, and columns in architecture
about the hedges. The Duke has added an ample laboratory, over against
which stands a fort on a hill, where they told us his treasure is kept.
In this Palace the Duke ordinarily resides, living with his Swiss guards,
after the frugal Italian way, and even selling what he can spare of his
wines, at the cellar under his very house, wicker bottles dangling over
even the chief entrance into the palace, serving for a vintner's bush.

In the Church of Santo Spirito the altar and reliquary are most rich, and
full of precious stones; there are four pillars of a kind of serpentine,
and some of blue. Hence we went to another Palace of the Duke's, called
Palazzo Vecchio, before which is a statue of David, by Michael Angelo,
and one of Hercules, killing Cacus, the work of Baccio Bandinelli. The
quadrangle about this is of the Corinthian order, and in the hall are
many rare marbles, as those of Leo X. and Clement VII., both Popes of the
Medicean family; also the acts of Cosmo, in rare painting. In the chapel
is kept (as they would make one believe) the original Gospel of St. John,
written with his own hand; and the famous Florentine Pandects, and
divers precious stones. Near it is another pendent Tower like that of
Pisa, always threatening ruin.

Under the Court of Justice is a stately arcade for men to walk in, and
over that, the shops of divers rare artists who continually work for the
great Duke. Above this is that renowned Ceimeliarcha, or repository,
wherein are hundreds of admirable antiquities, statues of marble and
metal, vases of porphyry, etc.; but among the statues none so famous as
the Scipio, the Boar, the Idol of Apollo, brought from the Delphic
Temple, and two triumphant columns. Over these hang the pictures of the
most famous persons and illustrious men in arts or arms, to the number of
300, taken out of the museum of Paulus Jovius. They then led us into a
large square room, in the middle of which stood a cabinet of an
octangular form, so adorned and furnished with crystals, agates, and
sculptures, as exceeds any description. This cabinet is called the
_Tribuna_ and in it is a pearl as big as an hazelnut. The cabinet is of
ebony, lazuli, and jasper; over the door is a round of M. Angelo; on the
cabinet, Leo X. with other paintings of Raphael, del Sarto, Perugino, and
Correggio, viz, a St. John, a Virgin, a Boy, two Apostles, two heads of
Durer, rarely carved. Over this cabinet is a globe of ivory, excellently
carved; the Labors of Hercules, in massy silver, and many incomparable
pictures in small. There is another, which had about it eight Oriental
columns of alabaster, on each whereof was placed a head of a Cæsar,
covered with a canopy so richly set with precious stones, that they
resembled a firmament of stars. Within it was our Savior's Passion, and
the twelve Apostles in amber. This cabinet was valued at two hundred
thousand crowns. In another, with calcedon pillars, was a series of
golden medals. Here is also another rich ebony cabinet cupolaed with a
tortoise shell, and containing a collection of gold medals esteemed worth
50,000 crowns; a wreathed pillar of Oriental alabaster, divers paintings
of Da Vinci, Pontorno, del Sarto, an _Ecce Homo_ of Titian, a Boy of
Bronzini, etc. They showed us a branch of coral fixed on the rock, which
they affirm does still grow. In another room, is kept the Tabernacle
appointed for the chapel of St. Laurence, about which are placed small
statues of Saints, of precious material; a piece of such art and cost,
that having been these forty years in perfecting, it is one of the most
curious things in the world. Here were divers tables of Pietra Commesso,
which is a marble ground inlaid with several sorts of marbles and stones
of various colors representing flowers, trees, beasts, birds, and
landscapes. In one is represented the town of Leghorn, by the same hand
who inlaid the altar of St. Laurence, Domenico Benotti, of whom I
purchased nineteen pieces of the same work for a cabinet. In a press near
this they showed an iron nail, one half whereof being converted into gold
by one Thurnheuser, a German chemist, is looked on as a great rarity; but
it plainly appeared to have been soldered together. There is a curious
watch, a monstrous turquoise as big as an egg, on which is carved an
emperor's head.

In the armory are kept many antique habits, as those of Chinese kings;
the sword of Charlemagne; Hannibal's headpiece; a loadstone of a yard
long, which bears up 86 lbs. weight, in a chain of seventeen links, such
as the slaves are tied to. In another room are such rare turneries in
ivory, as are not to be described for their curiosity. There is a fair
pillar of oriental alabaster; twelve vast and complete services of silver
plate, and one of gold, all of excellent workmanship; a rich embroidered
saddle of pearls sent by the Emperor to this Duke; and here is that
embroidered chair set with precious stones in which he sits, when, on St.
John's day, he receives the tribute of the cities.

25th October, 1644. We went to the Portico where the famous statue of
Judith and Holofernes stands, also the Medusa, all of copper; but what is
most admirable is the Rape of a Sabine, with another man under foot, the
confusion and turning of whose limbs is most admirable. It is of one
entire marble, the work of John di Bologna, and is most stupendous; this
stands directly against the great piazza, where, to adorn one fountain,
are erected four marble statues and eight of brass, representing Neptune
and his family of sea gods, of a Colossean magnitude, with four sea
horses, in Parian marble of Lamedrati, in the midst of a very great
basin: a work, I think, hardly to be paralleled. Here is also the famous
statue of David, by M. Angelo; Hercules and Cacus, by Baccio Bandinelli;
the Perseus, in copper, by Benevento, and the Judith of Donatelli, which
stand publicly before the old Palace with the Centaur of Bologna, huge
Colossean figures. Near this stand Cosmo di Medicis on horseback, in
brass on a pedestal of marble, and four copper bassorelievos by John di
Bologna, with divers inscriptions; the Ferdinand the First, on horseback,
is of Pietro Tacca. The brazen boar, which serves for another public
fountain, is admirable.

After dinner, we went to the Church of the Annunciata, where the Duke and
his Court were at their devotions, being a place of extraordinary repute
for sanctity: for here is a shrine that does great miracles, [proved] by
innumerable votive tablets, etc., covering almost the walls of the whole
church. This is the image of Gabriel, who saluted the Blessed Virgin, and
which the artist finished so well, that he was in despair of performing
the Virgin's face so well; whereupon it was miraculously done for him
while he slept; but others say it was painted by St. Luke himself.
Whoever it was, infinite is the devotion of both sexes to it. The altar
is set off with four columns of oriental alabaster, and lighted by thirty
great silver lamps. There are innumerable other pictures by rare masters.
Our Savior's Passion in brass tables inserted in marble, is the work of
John di Bologna and Baccio Bandinelli.

To this church joins a convent, whose cloister is painted in _fresco_
very rarely. There is also near it an hospital for 1,000 persons, with
nurse-children, and several other charitable accommodations.

At the Duke's Cavalerizza, the Prince has a stable of the finest horses
of all countries, Arabs, Turks, Barbs, Gennets, English, etc., which are
continually exercised in the _manège_.

Near this is a place where are kept several wild beasts, as wolves, cats,
bears, tigers, and lions. They are loose in a deep walled court, and
therefore to be seen with more pleasure than those at the Tower of
London, in their grates. One of the lions leaped to a surprising height,
to catch a joint of mutton which I caused to be hung down.

[Sidenote: SIENNA]

[20]There are many plain brick towers erected for defense, when this was
a free state. The highest is called the Mangio, standing at the foot of
the piazza which we went first to see after our arrival. At the entrance
of this tower is a chapel open toward the piazza, of marble well adorned
with sculpture.

    [Footnote 20: There seems to be here an omission in the MS. between
    their leaving Florence and going to Sienna.]

On the other side is the Signoria, or Court of Justice, well built _a la
moderna_, of brick; indeed the bricks of Sienna are so well made, that
they look almost as well as porphyry itself, having a kind of natural
polish.

In the Senate-house is a very fair Hall where they sometimes entertain
the people with public shows and operas, as they call them. Toward the
left are the statues of Romulus and Remus with the wolf, all of brass,
placed on a column of ophite stone, which they report was brought from
the renowned Ephesian Temple. These ensigns being the arms of the town,
are set up in divers of the streets and public ways both within and far
without the city.

The piazza compasses the facciáta of the court and chapel, and, being
made with descending steps, much resembles the figure of an escalop
shell. The white ranges of pavement, intermixed with the excellent bricks
above mentioned, with which the town is generally well paved, render it
very clean. About this market place (for so it is) are many fair palaces,
though not built with excess of elegance. There stands an arch, the work
of Baltazzar di Sienna, built with wonderful ingenuity, so that it is not
easy to conceive how it is supported, yet it has some imperceptible
contiguations, which do not betray themselves easily to the eye. On the
edge of the piazza is a goodly fountain beautified with statues, the
water issuing out of the wolves' mouths, being the work of Jacobo
Quercei, a famous artist. There are divers other public fountains in the
city, of good design.

After this we walked to the Sapienza, which is the University, or rather
College, where the high Germans enjoy many particular privileges when
they addict themselves to the civil law: and indeed this place has
produced many excellent scholars, besides those three Popes, Alexander,
Pius II., and III., of that name, the learned Æneas Sylvius; and both
were of the ancient house of the Piccolomini.

The chief street is called Strada Romana, in which Pius II. has built a
most stately palace of square stone, with an incomparable portico
joining near to it. The town is commanded by a castle which hath four
bastions and a garrison of soldiers. Near it is a list to ride horses in,
much frequented by the gallants in summer.

Not far from hence is the Church and Convent of the Dominicans, where in
the chapel of St. Catherine of Sienna they show her head, the rest of her
body being translated to Rome. The Duomo, or Cathedral, both without and
within, is of large square stones of black and white marble polished, of
inexpressible beauty, as is the front adorned with sculpture and rare
statues. In the middle is a stately cupola and two columns of sundry
streaked colored marble. About the body of the church, on a cornice
within, are inserted the heads of all the Popes. The pulpit is beautified
with marble figures, a piece of exquisite work; but what exceeds all
description is the pavement, where (besides the various emblems and other
figures in the nave) the choir is wrought with the history of the Bible,
so artificially expressed in the natural colors of the marbles, that few
pictures exceed it. Here stands a Christo, rarely cut in marble, and on
the large high altar is a brazen vessel of admirable invention and art.
The organs are exceeding sweet and well tuned. On the left side of the
altar is the library, where are painted the acts of Æneas Sylvius, and
others by Raphael. They showed us an arm of St. John the Baptist,
wherewith, they say, he baptized our Savior in Jordan; it was given by
the King of Peloponnesus to one of the Popes, as an inscription
testifies. They have also St. Peter's sword, with which he smote off the
ear of Malchus.

Just against the cathedral, we went into the Hospital, where they
entertain and refresh for three or four days, gratis, such pilgrims as go
to Rome. In the chapel belonging to it lies the body of St. Susorius,
their founder, as yet uncorrupted, though dead many hundreds of years.
They show one of the nails which pierced our Savior, and Saint
Chrysostom's "Comment on the Gospel," written by his own hand. Below the
hill stands the pool called Fonte Brande, where fish are fed for pleasure
more than food.

St. Francis's Church is a large pile, near which, yet a little without
the city, grows a tree which they report in their legend grew from the
Saint's staff, which, on going to sleep, he fixed in the ground, and at
his waking found it had grown a large tree. They affirm that the wood of
it in decoction cures sundry diseases.

[Sidenote: TORRINIERI]

2d November, 1644. We went from Sienna, desirous of being present at the
cavalcade of the new Pope, Innocent X.,[21] who had not yet made the
grand procession to St. John di Laterano. We set out by Porto Romano, the
country all about the town being rare for hunting and game. Wild boar and
venison are frequently sold in the shops in many of the towns about it.
We passed near Monte Oliveto, where the monastery of that Order is
pleasantly situated, and worth seeing. Passing over a bridge, which, by
the inscription, appears to have been built by Prince Matthias, we went
through Buon-Convento, famous for the death of the Emperor, Henry VII.,
who was here poisoned with the Holy Eucharist. Thence, we came to
Torrinieri, where we dined. This village is in a sweet valley, in view of
Montalcino, famous for the rare Muscatello.[22] After three miles more,
we go by St. Quirico, and lay at a private osteria near it, where, after
we were provided of lodging, came in Cardinal Donghi, a Genoese by birth,
now come from Rome; he was so civil as to entertain us with great
respect, hearing we were English, for that, he told us he had been once
in our country. Among other discourse, he related how a dove had been
seen to sit on the chair in the Conclave at the election of Pope
Innocent, which he magnified as a great good omen, with other particulars
which we inquired of him, till our suppers parted us. He came in great
state with his own bedstead and all the furniture, yet would by no means
suffer us to resign the room we had taken up in the lodging before his
arrival. Next morning, we rode by Monte Pientio, or, as vulgarly called,
Monte Mantumiato, which is of an excessive height, ever and anon peeping
above any clouds with its snowy head, till we had climbed to the inn at
Radicofani, built by Ferdinand, the great Duke, for the necessary
refreshment of travelers in so inhospitable a place. As we ascended, we
entered a very thick, solid, and dark body of clouds, looking like rocks
at a little distance, which lasted near a mile in going up; they were dry
misty vapors, hanging undissolved for a vast thickness, and obscuring
both the sun and earth, so that we seemed to be in the sea rather than in
the clouds, till, having pierced through it, we came into a most serene
heaven, as if we had been above all human conversation, the mountain
appearing more like a great island than joined to any other hills; for we
could perceive nothing but a sea of thick clouds rolling under our feet
like huge waves, every now and then suffering the top of some other
mountain to peep through, which we could discover many miles off: and
between some breaches of the clouds we could see landscapes and villages
of the subjacent country. This was one of the most pleasant, new, and
altogether surprising objects that I had ever beheld.

    [Footnote 21: John Baptista Pamphili, chosen Pope in October, 1644,
    died in 1655.]

    [Footnote 22: The wine so called.]

On the summit of this horrid rock (for so it is) is built a very strong
fort, garrisoned, and somewhat beneath it is a small town; the provisions
are drawn up with ropes and engines, the precipice being otherwise
inaccessible. At one end of the town lie heaps of rocks so strangely
broken off from the ragged mountain, as would affright one with their
horror and menacing postures. Just opposite to the inn gushed out a
plentiful and most useful fountain which falls into a great trough of
stone, bearing the Duke of Tuscany's arms. Here we dined, and I with my
black lead pen took the prospect. It is one of the utmost confines of the
Etrurian State toward St. Peter's Patrimony, since the gift of Matilda to
Gregory VII., as is pretended.

Here we pass a stone bridge, built by Pope Gregory XIV., and thence
immediately to Acquapendente, a town situated on a very ragged rock, down
which precipitates an entire river (which gives it the denomination),
with a most horrid roaring noise. We lay at the posthouse, on which is
this inscription:

    "_L'Insegna della Posta, é posta a posta,
    In questa posta, fin che habbia à sua posta
    Ogn'un Cavallo a Vetturi in Posta._"

Before it was dark, we went to see the Monastery of the Franciscans,
famous for six learned Popes, and sundry other great scholars, especially
the renowned physician and anatomist, Fabricius de Acquapendente, who was
bred and born there.

4th November, 1644. After a little riding, we descended toward the Lake
of Bolsena, which being above twenty miles in circuit, yields from hence
a most incomparable prospect. Near the middle of it are two small
islands, in one of which is a convent of melancholy Capuchins, where
those of the Farnesian family are interred. Pliny calls it _Tarquiniensis
Lacus_, and talks of divers floating islands about it, but they did not
appear to us. The lake is environed with mountains, at one of whose sides
we passed toward the town Bolsena, anciently Volsinium, famous in those
times, as is testified by divers rare sculptures in the court of St.
Christiana's church, the urn, altar, and jasper columns.

After seven miles' riding, passing through a wood heretofore sacred to
Juno, we came to Montefiascone, the head of the Falisci, a famous people
in old time, and heretofore Falernum, as renowned for its excellent wine,
as now for the story of the Dutch Bishop, who lies buried in St.
Flavian's church with this epitaph:

    "_Propter Est, Est, dominus meus mortuus est._"

Because, having ordered his servant to ride before, and inquire where the
best wine was, and there write _Est_, the man found some so good that he
wrote _Est, Est_, upon the vessels, and the Bishop drinking too much of
it, died.

[Sidenote: VITERBO]

From Montefiascone, we travel a plain and pleasant champaign to Viterbo,
which presents itself with much state afar off, in regard of her many
lofty pinnacles and towers; neither does it deceive our expectation; for
it is exceedingly beautified with public fountains, especially that at
the entrance, which is all of brass and adorned with many rare figures,
and salutes the passenger with a most agreeable object and refreshing
waters. There are many Popes buried in this city, and in the palace is
this odd inscription:

    "_Osiridis victoriam in Gigantas litteris historiographicis in hoc
    antiquissimo marmore inscriptam, ex Herculis olim, nunc Divi
    Laurentij Templo translatam, ad conversanda: vetustiss: patriæ
    monumenta atq' decora his locandum statuit S.P.Q.V._"

Under it:

    "_Sum Osiris Rex Jupiter universo in terrarum orbe._"

    "_Sum Osiris Rex qui ab Itala in Gigantes exercitus veni, vidi, et
    vici._"

    "_Sum Osiris Rex qui terrarum pacata Italiam decem a'nos quorum
    inventor fui._"

Near the town is a sulphurous fountain, which continually boils. After
dinner we took horse by the new way of Capranica, and so passing near
Mount Ciminus and the Lake, we began to enter the plains of Rome; at
which sight my thoughts were strangely elevated, but soon allayed by so
violent a shower, which fell just as we were contemplating that proud
Mistress of the world, and descending by the Vatican (for at that gate we
entered), that before we got into the city I was wet to the skin.

[Sidenote: ROME]

I came to Rome on the 4th of November, 1644, about five at night; and
being perplexed for a convenient lodging, wandered up and down on
horseback, till at last one conducted us to Monsieur Petit's, a
Frenchman, near the Piazza Spagnola. Here I alighted, and, having
bargained with my host for twenty crowns a month, I caused a good fire to
be made in my chamber and went to bed, being so very wet. The next
morning (for I was resolved to spend no time idly here) I got acquainted
with several persons who had long lived at Rome. I was especially
recommended to Father John, a Benedictine monk and Superior of his Order
for the English College of Douay, a person of singular learning,
religion, and humanity; also to Mr. Patrick Cary, an Abbot, brother to
our learned Lord Falkland, a witty young priest, who afterward came over
to our church; Dr. Bacon and Dr. Gibbs, physicians who had dependence on
Cardinal Caponi, the latter being an excellent poet; Father Courtney, the
chief of the Jesuits in the English College; my Lord of Somerset, brother
to the Marquis of Worcester; and some others, from whom I received
instructions how to behave in town, with directions to masters and books
to take in search of the antiquities, churches, collections, etc.
Accordingly, the next day, November 6th, I began to be very
pragmatical.[23]

    [Footnote 23: The sense in which Evelyn uses this word is that of
    its old signification, as being very active and full of business,
    setting to work systematically with what he came upon, namely, to
    view the antiquities and beauties of Rome.]

In the first place, our sights-man (for so they name certain persons here
who get their living by leading strangers about to see the city) went to
the Palace Farnese, a magnificent square structure, built by Michael
Angelo, of the three orders of columns after the ancient manner, and when
architecture was but newly recovered from the Gothic barbarity. The court
is square and terraced, having two pairs of stairs which lead to the
upper rooms, and conducted us to that famous gallery painted by Augustine
Caracci, than which nothing is more rare of that art; so deep and
well-studied are all the figures, that it would require more judgment
than I confess I had, to determine whether they were flat, or embossed.
Thence, we passed into another, painted in chiaroscúro, representing the
fabulous history of Hercules. We went out on a terrace, where was a
pretty garden on the leads, for it is built in a place that has no extent
of ground backward. The great hall is wrought by Salviati and Zuccharo,
furnished with statues, one of which being modern is the figure of a
Farnese, in a triumphant posture, of white marble, worthy of admiration.
Here we were shown the Museum of Fulvius Ursinos, replete with
innumerable collections; but the Major-Domo being absent, we could not at
this time see all we wished. Descending into the court, we with
astonishment contemplated those two incomparable statues of Hercules and
Flora, so much celebrated by Pliny, and indeed by all antiquity, as two
of the most rare pieces in the world; there likewise stands a modern
statue of Hercules and two Gladiators, not to be despised. In a second
court was a temporary shelter of boards over the most stupendous and
never-to-be-sufficiently-admired Torso of Amphion and Dirce, represented
in five figures, exceeding the life in magnitude, of the purest white
marble, the contending work of those famous statuaries, Apollonius and
Taurisco, in the time of Augustus, hewed out of one entire stone, and
remaining unblemished, to be valued beyond all the marbles of the world
for its antiquity and workmanship. There are divers other heads and
busts. At the entrance of this stately palace stand two rare and vast
fountains of garnito stone, brought into this piazza out of Titus's
Baths. Here, in summer, the gentlemen of Rome take the FRESCO in their
coaches and on foot. At the sides of this court, we visited the palace
of Signor Pichini, who has a good collection of antiquities, especially
the Adonis of Parian marble, which my Lord Arundel would once have
purchased, if a great price would have been taken for it.

We went into the CAMPO VACCINO, by the ruins of the Temple of Peace,
built by Titus Vespasianus, and thought to be the largest as well as the
most richly furnished of all the Roman dedicated places: it is now a heap
rather than a temple, yet the roof and _volto_ continue firm, showing it
to have been formerly of incomparable workmanship. This goodly structure
was, none knows how, consumed by fire the very night, by all computation,
that our blessed Savior was born.

From hence we passed by the place into which Curtius precipitated himself
for the love of his country, now without any sign of a lake, or vorago.
Near this stand some columns of white marble, of exquisite work, supposed
to be part of the Temple of Jupiter Tonans, built by Augustus; the work
of the capitals (being Corinthian) and architrave is excellent, full of
sacrificing utensils. There are three other of Jupiter Stator. Opposite
to these are the oratories, or churches, of St. Cosmo and Damiano,
heretofore the Temples of Romulus; a pretty old fabric, with a tribunal,
or tholus within, wrought all of Mosaic. The gates before it are brass,
and the whole much obliged to Pope Urban VIII. In this sacred place lie
the bodies of those two martyrs; and in a chapel on the right hand is a
rare painting of Cavaliere Baglioni.

We next entered St. Lorenzo in Miranda. The portico is supported by a
range of most stately columns; the inscription cut in the architrave
shows it to have been the Temple of Faustina. It is now made a fair
church, and has an hospital which joins it. On the same side is St.
Adriano, heretofore dedicated to Saturn. Before this was once placed a
military column, supposed to be set in the center of the city, from
whence they used to compute the distance of all the cities and places of
note under the dominion of those universal monarchs. To this church are
likewise brazen gates and a noble front; just opposite we saw the heaps
and ruins of Cicero's palace. Hence we went toward Mons Capitolinus, at
the foot of which stands the arch of Septimus Severus, full and entire,
save where the pedestal and some of the lower members are choked up with
ruins and earth. This arch is exceedingly enriched with sculpture and
trophies, with a large inscription. In the terrestrial and naval battles
here graven, is seen the Roman Aries (the battering-ram); and this was
the first triumphal arch set up in Rome. The Capitol, to which we climbed
by very broad steps, is built about a square court, at the right hand of
which, going up from Campo Vaccino, gushes a plentiful stream from the
statue of Tiber, in porphyry, very antique, and another representing
Rome; but, above all, is the admirable figure of Marforius, casting water
into a most ample concha. The front of this court is crowned with an
excellent fabric containing the Courts of Justice, and where the Criminal
Notary sits, and others. In one of the halls they show the statues of
Gregory XIII. and Paul III., with several others. To this joins a
handsome tower, the whole faciata adorned with noble statues, both on the
outside and on the battlements, ascended by a double pair of stairs, and
a stately Posario.

In the center of the court stands that incomparable horse bearing the
Emperor Marcus Aurelius, as big as the life, of Corinthian metal, placed
on a pedestal of marble, esteemed one of the noblest pieces of work now
extant, antique and very rare. There is also a vast head of a colossean
magnitude, of white marble, fixed in the wall. At the descending stairs
are set two horses of white marble governed by two naked slaves, taken to
be Castor and Pollux, brought from Pompey's Theatre. On the balustrade,
the trophies of Marius against the Cimbrians, very ancient and
instructive. At the foot of the steps toward the left hand is that
Colonna Miliaria, with the globe of brass on it, mentioned to have been
formerly set in Campo Vaccino. On the same hand, is the palace of the
Signiori Conservatori, or three Consuls, now the civil governors of the
city, containing the fraternities, or halls and guilds (as we call them),
of sundry companies, and other offices of state. Under the portico
within, are the statues of Augustus Cæsar, a Bacchus, and the so renowned
Colonna Rostrata of Duillius, with the excellent bassi-relievi. In a
smaller court, the statue of Constantine, on a fountain, a Minerva's head
of brass, and that of Commodus, to which belongs a hand, the thumb
whereof is at least an ell long, and yet proportionable; but the rest of
the _colosse_ is lost. In the corner of this court stand a horse and lion
fighting, as big as life, in white marble, exceedingly valued; likewise
the Rape of the Sabines; two cumbent figures of Alexander and Mammea; two
monstrous feet of a _colosse_ of Apollo; the Sepulchre of Agrippina; and
the standard, or antique measure of the Roman foot. Ascending by the
steps of the other corner, are inserted four basso-relievos, viz, the
triumph and sacrifice of Marcus Aurelius, which last, for the antiquity
and rareness of the work, I caused my painter, Carlo Neapolitano, to
copy. There are also two statues of the Muses, and one of Adrian, the
Emperor; above stands the figure of Marius, and by the wall Marsyas bound
to a tree; all of them excellent and antique. Above in the lobby are
inserted into the walls those ancient laws, on brass, called the Twelve
Tables; a fair Madonna of Pietro Perugino, painted on the wall; near
which are the archives, full of ancient records.

In the great hall are divers excellent paintings of Cavaliero Giuseppe
d'Arpino, a statue in brass of Sextus V. and of Leo X., of marble. In
another hall are many modern statues of their late Consuls and Governors,
set about with fine antique heads; others are painted by excellent
masters, representing the actions of M. Scævola, Horatius Cocles, etc.
The room where the Conservatori now feast upon solemn days, is tapestried
with crimson damask, embroidered with gold, having a state or
_balduquino_ of crimson velvet, very rich; the frieze above rarely
painted. Here are in brass, Romulus and Remus sucking the wolf, of brass,
with the Shepherd, Faustulus, by them; also the boy plucking the thorn
out of his foot, of brass, so much admired by artists. There are also
holy statues and heads of Saints. In a gallery near adjoining are the
names of the ancient Consuls, Prætors, and Fasti Romani, so celebrated by
the learned; also the figure of an old woman; two others representing
Poverty; and more in fragments. In another large room, furnished with
velvet, are the statue of Adonis, very rare, and divers antique heads. In
the next chamber, is an old statue of Cicero, one of another Consul, a
Hercules in brass, two women's heads of incomparable work, six other
statues; and, over the chimney, a very rare basso-relievo, and other
figures. In a little lobby before the chapel, is the statue of Hannibal,
a Bacchus very antique, _bustoes_ of Pan and Mercury, with other old
heads. All these noble statues, etc., belong to the city, and cannot be
disposed of to any private person, or removed hence, but are preserved
for the honor of the place, though great sums have been offered for them
by divers Princes, lovers of art, and antiquity. We now left the Capitol,
certainly one of the most renowned places in the world, even as now built
by the design of the famous M. Angelo.

Returning home by Ara Coeli, we mounted to it by more than 100 marble
steps, not in devotion, as I observed some to do on their bare knees, but
to see those two famous statues of Constantine, in white marble, placed
there out of his baths. In this church is a Madonna, reported to be
painted by St. Luke, and a column, on which we saw the print of a foot,
which they affirm to have been that of the Angel, seen on the Castle of
St. Angelo. Here the feast of our Blessed Savior's nativity being yearly
celebrated with divers pageants, they began to make the preparation.
Having viewed the Palace and fountain, at the other side of the stairs,
we returned weary to our lodgings.

On the 7th of November, we went again near the Capitol, toward the
Tarpeian rock, where it has a goodly prospect of the Tiber. Thence,
descending by the Tullianum, where they told us St. Peter was imprisoned,
they showed us a chapel (S. Pietro de Vincoli) in which a rocky side of
it bears the impression of his face. In the nave of the church gushes a
fountain, which they say was caused by the Apostle's prayers, when having
converted some of his fellow-captives he wanted water to make them
Christians. The painting of the Ascension is by Raphael. We then walked
about Mount Palatinus and the Aventine, and thence to the Circus Maximus,
capable of holding 40,000 spectators, now a heap of ruins, converted into
gardens. Then by the _Forum Boarium_, where they have a tradition that
Hercules slew Cacus, some ruins of his temple remaining. The Temple of
Janus Quadrifrons, having four arches, importing the four Seasons, and on
each side niches for the months, is still a substantial and pretty entire
antiquity. Near to this is the Arcus Argentariorum. Bending now toward
the Tiber, we went into the Theater of Marcellus, which would hold 80,000
persons, built by Augustus, and dedicated to his nephew; the
architecture, from what remains, appears to be inferior to none. It is
now wholly converted into the house of the Savelli, one of the old Roman
families. The people were now generally busy in erecting temporary
triumphs and arches with statues and flattering inscriptions against his
Holiness's grand procession to St. John di Laterani, among which the Jews
also began one in testimony of gratitude for their protection under the
Papal State. The Palazzo Barberini, designed by the present Pope's
architect, Cavaliero Bernini, seems from the size to be as princely an
object, as any modern building in Europe. It has a double portico, at the
end of which we ascended by two pair of oval stairs, all of stone, and
void in the well. One of these led us into a stately hall, the _volto_
whereof was newly painted _á fresco_, by the rare hand of Pietro
Berretini il Cortone. To this is annexed a gallery completely furnished
with whatever art can call rare and singular, and a library full of
worthy collections, medals, marbles, and manuscripts; but, above all, an
Egyptian Osiris, remarkable for its unknown material and antiquity. In
one of the rooms near this hangs the Sposaliccio of St. Sebastian, the
original of Annibal Caracci, of which I procured a copy, little inferior
to the prototype; a table, in my judgment, superior to anything I had
seen in Rome. In the court is a vast broken guglia, or obelisk, having
divers hieroglyphics cut on it.

8th November, 1644. We visited the Jesuits' Church, the front whereof is
esteemed a noble piece of architecture, the design of Jacomo della Porta
and the famous Vignola. In this church lies the body of their renowned
Ignatius Loyola, an arm of Xaverius, their other Apostle; and, at the
right end of their high altar, their champion, Cardinal Bellarmine. Here
Father Kircher (professor of Mathematics and the oriental tongues) showed
us many singular courtesies, leading us into their refectory,
dispensatory, laboratory, gardens, and finally (through a hall hung round
with pictures of such of their order as had been executed for their
pragmatical and busy adventures) into his own study, where, with Dutch
patience, he showed us his perpetual motions, catoptrics, magnetical
experiments, models, and a thousand other crotchets and devices, most of
them since published by himself, or his industrious scholar, Schotti.

Returning home, we had time to view the Palazzo de Medicis, which was an
house of the Duke of Florence near our lodging, upon the brow of Mons
Pincius, having a fine prospect toward the Campo Marzo. It is a
magnificent, strong building, with a substruction very remarkable, and a
portico supported with columns toward the gardens, with two huge lions,
of marble, at the end of the balustrade. The whole outside of the
_facciata_ is incrusted with antique and rare basso-relievos and statues.
Descending into the garden is a noble fountain governed by a Mercury of
brass. At a little distance, on the left, is a lodge full of fine
statues, among which the Sabines, antique and singularly rare. In the
arcade near this stand twenty-four statues of great price, and hard by is
a mount planted with cypresses, representing a fortress, with a goodly
fountain in the middle. Here is also a row balustred with white marble,
covered over with the natural shrubs, ivy, and other perennial greens,
divers statues and heads being placed as in niches. At a little distance
are those famed statues of Niobe and her family, in all fifteen, as large
as the life, of which we have ample mention in Pliny, esteemed among the
best pieces of work in the world for the passions they express, and all
other perfections of that stupendous art. There is likewise in this
garden a fair obelisk, full of hieroglyphics. In going out, the fountain
before the front casts water near fifty feet in height, when it is
received in a most ample marble basin. Here they usually rode the great
horse every morning; which gave me much diversion from the terrace of my
own chamber, where I could see all their motions. This evening, I was
invited to hear rare music at the Chiesa Nova; the black marble pillars
within led us to that most precious oratory of Philippus Nerius, their
founder; they being of the oratory of secular priests, under no vow.
There are in it divers good pictures, as the Assumption of Girolamo
Mutiano; the Crucifix; the Visitation of Elizabeth; the Presentation of
the Blessed Virgin; Christo Sepolto, of Guido Rheno, Caravaggio, Arpino,
and others. This fair church consists of fourteen altars, and as many
chapels. In it is buried (besides their Saint) Cæsar Baronius, the great
annalist. Through this, we went into the _sacristia_, where, the tapers
being lighted, one of the Order preached; after him stepped up a child of
eight or nine years old, who pronounced an oration with so much grace,
that I never was better pleased than to hear Italian so well and so
intelligently spoken. This course it seems they frequently use, to bring
their scholars to a habit of speaking distinctly, and forming their
action and assurance, which none so much want as ours in England. This
being finished, began their _motettos_, which in a lofty cupola richly
painted, were sung by eunuchs, and other rare voices, accompanied by
theorbos, harpsichords, and viols, so that we were even ravished with the
entertainment of the evening. This room is painted by Cortona, and has in
it two figures in the niches, and the church stands in one of the most
stately streets of Rome.

10th November, 1644. We went to see Prince Ludovisio's villa, where was
formerly the _Viridarium_ of the poet, Sallust. The house is very
magnificent, and the extent of the ground exceedingly large, considering
that it is in a city; in every quarter of the garden are antique statues,
and walks planted with cypress. To this garden belongs a house of
retirement, built in the figure of a cross, after a particular
ordonnance, especially the staircase. The whiteness and smoothness of the
excellent pargeting was a thing I much observed, being almost as even and
polished, as if it had been of marble. Above, is a fair prospect of the
city. In one of the chambers hang two famous pieces of Bassano, the one a
Vulcan, the other a Nativity; there is a German clock full of rare and
extraordinary motions; and, in a little room below are many precious
marbles, columns, urns, vases, and noble statues of porphyry, oriental
alabaster, and other rare materials. About this fabric is an ample area,
environed with sixteen vast jars of red earth, wherein the Romans used to
preserve their oil, or wine rather, which they buried, and such as are
properly called _testæ_. In the Palace I must never forget the famous
statue of the Gladiator, spoken of by Pliny, so much followed by all the
rare artists as the many copies testify, dispersed through almost all
Europe, both in stone and metal. There is also a Hercules, a head of
porphyry, and one of Marcus Aurelius. In the villa-house is a man's body
flesh and all, petrified, and even converted to marble, as it was found
in the Alps, and sent by the Emperor to one of the Popes; it lay in a
chest, or coffin, lined with black velvet, and one of the arms being
broken, you may see the perfect bone from the flesh which remains entire.
The Rape of Proserpine, in marble, is of the purest white, the work of
Bernini. In the cabinet near it are innumerable small brass figures, and
other curiosities. But what some look upon as exceeding all the rest, is
a very rich bedstead (which sort of gross furniture the Italians much
glory in, as formerly did our grandfathers in England in their inlaid
wooden ones) inlaid with all sorts of precious stones and antique heads,
onyxes, agates, and cornelians, esteemed to be worth 80 or 90,000 crowns.
Here are also divers cabinets and tables of the Florence work, besides
pictures in the gallery, especially the Apollo--a conceited chair to
sleep in with the legs stretched out, with hooks, and pieces of wood to
draw out longer or shorter.

From this villa, we went to see Signor Angeloni's study, who very
courteously showed us such a collection of rare medals as is hardly to be
paralleled; divers good pictures, and many outlandish and Indian
curiosities, and things of nature.

From him, we walked to Monte Cavallo, heretofore called Mons Quirinalis,
where we saw those two rare horses, the work of the rivals Phidias and
Praxiteles, as they were sent to Nero (by Tiridates King) out of Armenia.
They were placed on pedestals of white marble by Sextus V., by whom I
suppose their injuries were repaired, and are governed by four naked
slaves, like those at the foot of the Capitol. Here runs a most noble
fountain, regarding four of the most stately streets for building and
beauty to be seen in any city of Europe. Opposite to these statues is the
Pope's summer palace, built by Gregory XIII.; and, in my opinion, it is,
for largeness and the architecture, one of the most conspicuous in Rome,
having a stately portico which leads round the court under columns, in
the centre of which there runs a beautiful fountain. The chapel is
incrusted with such precious materials, that nothing can be more rich,
or glorious, nor are the other ornaments and movables about it at all
inferior. The hall is painted by Lanfranci, and others. The garden, which
is called the Belvedere di Monte Cavallo, in emulation of that of the
Vatican, is most excellent for air and prospect; its exquisite fountains,
close walks, grots, piscinas, or stews for fish, planted about with
venerable cypresses, and refreshed with water-music, aviaries, and other
rarities.

12th November, 1644. We saw Dioclesian's Baths, whose ruins testify the
vastness of the original foundation and magnificence; by what M. Angelo
took from the ornaments about it, 'tis said he restored the then almost
lost art of architecture. This monstrous pile was built by the labor of
the primitive Christians, then under one of the ten great persecutions.
The Church of St. Bernardo is made out of one only of these ruinous
cupolas, and is in the form of an urn with a cover.

Opposite to this, is the Fontana delle Therme, otherwise called _Fons
Felix_; in it is a basso-relievo of white marble, representing Moses
striking the rock, which is adorned with camels, men, women, and children
drinking, as large as life; a work for the design and vastness truly
magnificent. The water is conveyed no less than twenty-two miles in an
aqueduct by Sextus V., _ex agro Columna_, by way of Præneste, as the
inscription testifies. It gushes into three ample lavers raised about
with stone, before which are placed two lions of a strange black stone,
very rare and antique. Near this are the store-houses for the city's
corn, and over against it the Church of St. Susanna, where were the
gardens of Sallust. The faciàta of this church is noble, the _soffito_
within gilded and full of pictures; especially famous is that of Susanna,
by Baldassa di Bologna. The tribunal of the high altar is of exquisite
work, from whose marble steps you descend under ground to the repository
of divers Saints. The picture over this altar is the work of Jacomo
Siciliano. The foundation is for Bernadine Nuns.

Santa Maria della Vittoria presents us with the most ravishing front. In
this church was sung the Te Deum by Gregory XV., after the signal victory
of the Emperor at Prague; the standards then taken still hang up, and the
impress waving this motto over the Pope's arms, _Extirpentur_. I
observed that the high altar was much frequented for an image of the
Virgin. It has some rare statues, as Paul ravished into the third heaven,
by Fiamingo, and some good pictures. From this, we bent toward
Dioclesian's Baths, never satisfied with contemplating that immense pile,
in building which 150,000 Christians were destined to labor fourteen
years, and were then all murdered. Here is a monastery of Carthusians,
called Santa Maria degli Angeli, the architecture of M. Angelo, and the
cloister encompassing walls in an ample garden.

Mont Alto's villa is entered by a stately gate of stone built on the
Viminalis, and is no other than a spacious park full of fountains,
especially that which salutes us at the front; stews for fish; the
cypress walks are so beset with statues, inscriptions, relievos, and
other ancient marbles, that nothing can be more stately and solemn. The
citron trees are uncommonly large. In the palace joining to it are
innumerable collections of value. Returning, we stepped into St. Agnes
church, where there is a tribunal of antique mosaic, and on the altar a
most rich ciborio of brass, with a statue of St. Agnes in oriental
alabaster. The church of Santa Constanza has a noble cupola. Here they
showed us a stone ship borne on a column heretofore sacred to Bacchus, as
the relievo intimates by the drunken emblems and instruments wrought upon
it. The altar is of rich porphyry, as I remember. Looking back, we had
the entire view of the Via Pia down to the two horses before the Monte
Cavallo, before mentioned, one of the most glorious sights for state and
magnificence that any city can show a traveler. We returned by Porta Pia,
and the Via Salaria, near Campo Scelerato, in whose gloomy caves the
wanton Vestals were heretofore immured alive.

Thence to Via Felix, a straight and noble street but very precipitous,
till we came to the four fountains of Lepidus, built at the abutments of
four stately ways, making an exact cross of right angles; and, at the
fountains, are as many cumbent figures of marble, under very large niches
of stone, the water pouring into huge basins. The church of St. Carlo is
a singular fabric for neatness, of an oval design, built of a new white
stone; the columns are worth notice. Under it is another church of a
structure nothing less admirable.

Next, we came to Santa Maria Maggiore, built upon the Esqueline Mountain,
which gives it a most conspicuous face to the street at a great distance.
The design is mixed partly antique, partly modern. Here they affirm that
the Blessed Virgin appearing, showed where it should be built 300 years
since. The first pavement is rare and antique; so is the portico built by
P. P. Eugenius II. The _ciborio_ is the work of Paris Romano, and the
tribunal of Mosaic.

We were showed in the church a _concha_ of porphyry, wherein they say
Patricius, the founder, lies. This is one of the most famous of the seven
Roman Churches, and is, in my opinion at least, after St. Peter's, the
most magnificent. Above all, for incomparable glory and materials, are
the two chapels of Sextus V. and Paulus V. That of Sextus was designed by
Dom. Fontana, in which are two rare great statues, and some good pieces
of painting; and here they pretended to show some of the Holy Innocents'
bodies slain by Herod: as also that renowned tabernacle of metal, gilt,
sustained by four angels, holding as many tapers, placed on the altar. In
this chapel is the statue of Sextus, in copper, with basso-relievos of
most of his famous acts, in Parian marble; but that of P. Paulus, which
we next entered, opposite to this, is beyond all imagination glorious,
and above description. It is so encircled with agates, and other most
precious materials, as to dazzle and confound the beholders. The
basso-relievos are for the most part of pure snowy marble, intermixed
with figures of molten brass, double gilt, on _lapis lazuli_. The altar
is a most stupendous piece; but most incomparable is the cupola painted
by Giuseppe Rheni, and the present Baglioni, full of exquisite
sculptures. There is a most sumptuous _sacristia_; and the piece over the
altar was by the hand of St. Luke; if you will believe it. Paulus V. hath
here likewise built two other altars; under the one lie the bones of the
Apostle, St. Matthias. In another oratory, is the statue of this Pope,
and the head of the Congo Ambassador, who was converted at Rome, and died
here. In a third chapel, designed by Michael Angelo, lie the bodies of
Platina, and the Cardinal of Toledo, Honorius III., Nicephorus IV., the
ashes of St. Hierom, and many others. In that of Sextus V., before
mentioned, was showed us part of the crib in which Christ was swaddled
at Bethlehem; there is also the statue of Pius V.; and going out at the
further end, is the resurrection of Lazarus, by a very rare hand. In the
portico, is this late inscription: "_Cardinal Antonio Barberino
Archypresbytero, aream marmoream quam Christianorum pietas exsculpsit,
laborante sub Tyrannis ecclesiâ, ut esset loci sanctitate venerabilior,
Francis Gualdus Arm. Eques S. Stephani è suis ædibus huc transtulit et
ornavit, 1632_." Just before this portico, stands a very sublime and
stately Corinthian column, of white marble, translated hither for an
ornament from the old Temple of Peace, built by Vespasian, having on the
plinth of the capital the image of our Lady, gilt on metal; at the
pedestal runs a fountain. Going down the hill, we saw the obelisk taken
from the Mausoleum of Augustus, and erected in this place by Domenico
Fontana, with this epigraph: "_Sextus V. Pont. Max. Obeliscum ex Egypto
advectum, Augusti in Mausoleo dicatum, eversum deinde et in plures
confractum partes, in via ad S. Rochum jacentem, in pristinam faciem
restitutum Salutiferæ Cruci feliciùs hic erigi jussit, anno MDLXXXVIII,
Pont. III_"; and so we came weary to our lodgings.

At the foot of this hill, is the church of St. Prudentia, in which is a
well, filled with the blood and bones of several martyrs, but grated over
with iron, and visited by many devotees. Near this stands the church of
her sister, S. Praxedeis, much frequented for the same reason. In a
little obscure place, canceled in with iron work, is the pillar, or
stump, at which they relate our Blessed Savior was scourged, being full
of bloody spots, at which the devout sex are always rubbing their
chaplets, and convey their kisses by a stick having a tassel on it. Here,
besides a noble statue of St. Peter, is the tomb of the famous Cardinal
Cajetan, an excellent piece; and here they hold that St. Peter said his
first mass at Rome, with the same altar and the stone he kneeled on, he
having been first lodged in this house, as they compute about the
forty-fourth year of the Incarnation. They also show many relics, or
rather rags, of his mantle. St. Laurence in Panisperna did next invite
us, where that martyr was cruelly broiled on the gridiron, there yet
remaining. St. Bridget is buried in this church under a stately monument.
In the front of the pile is the suffering of St. Laurence painted _á
fresco_ on the wall. The fabric is nothing but Gothic. On the left is the
Therma Novatii; and, on the right, Agrippina's Lavacrum.

14th November, 1644. We passed again through the stately Capitol and
Campo Vaccino toward the Amphitheater of Vespasian, but first stayed to
look at Titus's Triumphal Arch, erected by the people of Rome, in honor
of his victory at Jerusalem; on the left hand whereof he is represented
drawn in a chariot with four horses abreast; on the right hand, or side
of the arch within, is sculptured in figures, or basso-relievo as big as
the life (and in one entire marble) the Ark of the Covenant, on which
stands the seven-branched candlestick described in Leviticus, as also the
two Tables of the Law, all borne on men's shoulders by the bars, as they
are described in some of St. Hierom's bibles; before this, go many
crowned and laureated figures, and twelve Roman _fasces_ with other
sacred vessels. This much confirmed the idea I before had; and therefore,
for the light it gave to the Holy History, I caused my painter, Carlo, to
copy it exactly. The rest of the work of the Arch is of the noblest, best
understood _composita_; and the inscription is this, in capital letters:

                      S. P. Q. R.
    D. TITO, D. VESPASIANI, F. VESPASIANI AVGVSTO.

Santa Maria Nova is on the place where they told us Simon Magus fell out
of the air at St. Peter's prayer, and burst himself to pieces on a flint.
Near this is a marble monument, erected by the people of Rome in memory
of the Pope's return from Avignon. Being now passed the ruins of
Meta-Sudante (which stood before the Colosseum, so called, because there
once stood here the statue of Commodus provided to refresh the
gladiators), we enter the mighty ruins of the Vespasian Amphitheatre,
begun by Vespasian, and finished by that excellent prince, Titus. It is
830 Roman palms in length (_i.e._ 130 paces), 90 in breadth at the area,
with caves for the wild beasts which used to be baited by men instead of
dogs; the whole oval periphery 2888-4/7 palms, and capable of containing
87,000 spectators with ease and all accommodation: the three rows of
circles are yet entire; the first was for the senators, the middle for
the nobility, the third for the people. At the dedication of this place
were 5,000 wild beasts slain in three months during which the feast
lasted, to the expense of ten millions of gold. It was built of Tiburtine
stone, a vast height, with the five orders of architecture, by 30,000
captive Jews. It is without, of a perfect circle, and was once adorned
thick with statues, and remained entire, till of late that some of the
stones were carried away to repair the city walls and build the Farnesian
palace. That which still appears most admirable is, the contrivance of
the porticos, vaults, and stairs, with the excessive altitude, which well
deserves this distich of the poet:

    "_Omnis Cæsareo cedat labor Amphitheatro;
    Unum pro cunctis fama loquatur opus._"

Near it is a small chapel called Santa Maria della Pieta nel Colisseo,
which is erected on the steps, or stages, very lofty at one of its sides,
or ranges, within, and where there lives only a melancholy hermit. I
ascended to the very top of it with wonderful admiration.

The Arch of Constantine the Great is close by the Meta-Sudante, before
mentioned, at the beginning of the Via Appia, on one side Monte Celio,
and is perfectly entire, erected by the people in memory of his victory
over Maxentius, at the Pons Milvius, now Ponte Mole. In the front is this
inscription:

    IMP. CAES. FL. CONSTANTINO MAXIMO
        P. F. AVGVSTO S. P. Q. R.
    QVOD INSTINCTV DIVINITATIS MENTIS
       MAGNITVDINE CVM EXERCITV SVO
     TAM DE TYRANNO QVAM DE OMNI EIVS
       FACTIONE VNO TEMPORE IVSTIS
       REMPVBLICAM VLTVS EST ARMIS
    ARCVM TRIVMPHIS INSIGNEM DICAVIT.

Hence, we went to St. Gregorio, in Monte Celio, where are many privileged
altars, and there they showed us an arm of that saint, and other relics.
Before this church stands a very noble portico.

15th November, 1644. Was very wet, and I stirred not out, and the 16th I
went to visit Father John, Provincial of the Benedictines.

17th November, 1644. I walked to Villa Borghese, a house and ample garden
on Mons Pincius, yet somewhat without the city walls, circumscribed by
another wall full of small turrets and banqueting-houses; which makes it
appear at a distance like a little town. Within it is an elysium of
delight, having in the centre of it a noble palace; but the entrance of
the garden presents us with a very glorious fabric, or rather door-case,
adorned with divers excellent marble statues. This garden abounded with
all sorts of delicious fruit and exotic simples, fountains of sundry
inventions, groves, and small rivulets. There is also adjoining to it a
vivarium for ostriches, peacocks, swans, cranes, etc., and divers strange
beasts, deer, and hares. The grotto is very rare, and represents, among
other devices, artificial rain, and sundry shapes of vessels, flowers,
etc.; which is effected by changing the heads of the fountains. The
groves are of cypress, laurel, pine, myrtle, and olive. The four sphinxes
are very antique, and worthy observation. To this is a volary, full of
curious birds. The house is square with turrets, from which the prospect
is excellent toward Rome, and the environing hills, covered as they now
are with snow, which indeed commonly continues even a great part of the
summer, affording sweet refreshment. Round the house is a baluster of
white marble, with frequent jettos of water, and adorned with a multitude
of statues. The walls of the house are covered with antique incrustations
of history, as that of Curtius, the Rape of Europa, Leda, etc. The
cornices above consist of fruitages and festoons, between which are
niches furnished with statues, which order is observed to the very roof.
In the lodge, at the entry, are divers good statues of Consuls, etc.,
with two pieces of field artillery upon carriages, (a mode much practiced
in Italy before the great men's houses) which they look on as a piece of
state more than defense. In the first hall within, are the twelve Roman
Emperors, of excellent marble; between them stand porphyry columns, and
other precious stones of vast height and magnitude, with urns of oriental
alabaster. Tables of pietra-commessa: and here is that renowned Diana
which Pompey worshiped, of eastern marble: the most incomparable Seneca
of touch, bleeding in an huge vase of porphyry, resembling the drops of
his blood; the so famous Gladiator, and the Hermaphrodite upon a quilt of
stone. The new piece of Daphne, and David, of Cavaliero Bernini, is
observable for the pure whiteness of the stone, and the art of the
statuary plainly stupendous. There is a multitude of rare pictures of
infinite value, by the best masters; huge tables of porphyry, and two
exquisitely wrought vases of the same. In another chamber, are divers
sorts of instruments of music: among other toys that of a satyr, which so
artificially expressed a human voice, with the motion of eyes and head,
that it might easily afright one who was not prepared for that most
extravagant sight. They showed us also a chair that catches fast any one
who sits down in it, so as not to be able to stir out, by certain springs
concealed in the arms and back thereof, which at sitting down surprises a
man on the sudden, locking him in by the arms and thighs, after a true
treacherous Italian guise. The perspective is also considerable, composed
by the position of looking-glasses, which render a strange multiplication
of things resembling divers most richly furnished rooms. Here stands a
rare clock of German work; in a word, nothing but what is magnificent is
to be seen in this Paradise.

The next day, I went to the Vatican, where, in the morning, I saw the
ceremony of Pamfilio, the Pope's nephew, receiving a Cardinal's hat; this
was the first time I had seen his Holiness _in pontificalibus_. After the
Cardinals and Princes had met in the consistory, the ceremony was in the
Pope's chapel, where he was at the altar invested with most pompous
rites.

19th November, 1644. I visited St. Peter's, that most stupendous and
incomparable Basilica, far surpassing any now extant in the world, and
perhaps, Solomon's Temple excepted, any that was ever built. The
largeness of the piazza before the portico is worth observing, because it
affords a noble prospect of the church, not crowded up, as for the most
part is the case in other places where great churches are erected. In
this is a fountain, out of which gushes a river rather than a stream
which, ascending a good height, breaks upon a round emboss of marble into
millions of pearls that fall into the subjacent basins with great noise;
I esteem this one of the goodliest fountains I ever saw.

Next is the obelisk transported out of Egypt, and dedicated by Octavius
Augustus to Julius Cæsar, whose ashes it formerly bore on the summit;
but, being since overturned by the barbarians, was re-erected with vast
cost and a most stupendous invention by Domenico Fontana, architect to
Sextus V. The obelisk consists of one entire square stone without
hieroglyphics, in height seventy-two feet, but comprehending the base and
all it is 108 feet high, and rests on four lions of gilded copper, so as
you may see through the base of the obelisk and plinth of the pedestal.

Upon two faces of the obelisk is engraven

      DIVO CAES. DIVI
     IVLII F. AVGVSTO
    TI. CAES. DIVI AVG.
     F. AVGVS. SACRVM.

It now bears on the top a cross in which it is said that Sextus V.
inclosed some of the holy wood; and under it is to be read by good eyes:

        SANCTISSIMAE CRVCI
       SEXTVS V. PONT. MAX.
           CONSECRAVIT.
      E. PRIORE SEDE AVVLSVM
      ET CAESS. AVG. AC TIB.
    I. L. ABLATUM M.D.LXXXVI.

On the four faces of the base below:

           1. CHRISTVS VINCIT.
            CHRISTVS REGNAT.
            CHRISTVS IMPERAT.
          CHRISTVS AB OMNI MALO

       AN. M.D.L.XXXVI. PONT. II.

A little lower:

    DOMINICVS FONTANA EX PAGO MILIAGRI NOVOCOMENSIS
                   TRANSTVLIT ET EREXIT.

It is reported to have taken a year in erecting, to have cost 37,975
crowns, the labor of 907 men, and 75 horses: this being the first of the
four Egyptian obelisks set up at Rome, and one of the forty-two brought
to the city out of Egypt, set up in several places, but thrown down by
the Goths, Barbarians, and earthquakes. Some coaches stood before the
steps of the ascent, whereof one, belonging to Cardinal Medici, had all
the metal work of massy silver, viz, the bow behind and other places. The
coaches at Rome, as well as covered wagons also much in use, are
generally the richest and largest I ever saw. Before the _facciata_ of
the church is an ample pavement. The church was first begun by St.
Anacletus, when rather a chapel, on a foundation, as they give out, of
Constantine the Great, who, in honor of the Apostles, carried twelve
baskets full of sand to the work. After him, Julius II. took it in hand,
to which all his successors have contributed more or less.

The front is supposed to be the largest and best-studied piece of
architecture in the world; to this we went up by four steps of marble.
The first entrance is supported by huge pilasters; the _volto_ within is
the richest possible, and overlaid with gold. Between the five large
anti-ports are columns of enormous height and compass, with as many gates
of brass, the work and sculpture of Pollaivola, the Florentine, full of
cast figures and histories in a deep relievo. Over this runs a terrace of
like amplitude and ornament, where the Pope, at solemn times, bestows his
Benediction on the vulgar. On each side of this portico are two
_campaniles_, or towers, whereof there was but one perfected, of
admirable art. On the top of all, runs a balustrade which edges it quite
round, and upon this at equal distances are Christ and the twelve
Disciples of gigantic size and stature, yet below showing no greater than
the life. Entering the church, admirable is the breadth of the _volto_,
or roof, which is all carved with foliage and roses overlaid with gold in
nature of a deep basso-relievo, _à l'antique_. The nave, or body, is in
form of a cross, whereof the foot-part is the longest; and, at the
_internodium_ of the transept, rises the cupola, which being all of stone
and of prodigious height is more in compass than that of the Pantheon
(which was the largest among the old Romans, and is yet entire) or any
other known. The inside, or concave, is covered with most exquisite
Mosaic, representing the Celestial Hierarchy, by Giuseppe d'Arpino, full
of stars of gold; the convex, or outside, exposed to the air, is covered
with lead, with great ribs of metal double gilt (as are also the ten
other lesser cupolas, for no fewer adorn this glorious structure), which
gives a great and admirable splendor in all parts of the city. On the
summit of this is fixed a brazen globe gilt, capable of receiving
thirty-five persons. This I entered, and engraved my name among other
travelers. Lastly, is the Cross, the access to which is between the
leaden covering and the stone convex, or arch-work; a most truly
astonishing piece of art! On the battlements of the church, also all
overlaid with lead and marble, you would imagine yourself in a town, so
many are the cupolas, pinnacles, towers, juttings, and not a few houses
inhabited by men who dwell there, and have enough to do to look after the
vast reparations which continually employ them.

Having seen this, we descended into the body of the church, full of
collateral chapels and large oratories, most of them exceeding the size
of ordinary churches; but the principal are four incrusted with most
precious marbles and stones of various colors, adorned with an infinity
of statues, pictures, stately altars, and innumerable relics. The
altar-piece of St. Michael being of Mosaic, I could not pass without
particular note, as one of the best of that kind. The chapel of Gregory
XIII., where he is buried, is most splendid. Under the cupola, and in the
center of the church, stands the high altar, consecrated first by Clement
VIII., adorned by Paul V., and lately covered by Pope Urban VIII.; with
that stupendous canopy of Corinthian brass, which heretofore was brought
from the Pantheon; it consists of four wreathed columns, partly
channelled and encircled with vines, on which hang little _puti_ birds
and bees (the arms of the _Barberini_), sustaining a _baldacchino_ of the
same metal. The four columns weigh an hundred and ten thousand pounds,
all over richly gilt; this, with the pedestals, crown, and statues about
it, form a thing of that art, vastness, and magnificence, as is beyond
all that man's industry has produced of the kind; it is the work of
Bernini, a Florentine sculptor, architect, painter, and poet, who, a
little before my coming to the city, gave a public opera (for so they
call shows of that kind), wherein he painted the scenes, cut the statues,
invented the engines, composed the music, writ the comedy, and built the
theater. Opposite to either of these pillars, under those niches which,
with their columns, support the weighty cupola, are placed four exquisite
statues of Parian marble, to which are four altars; that of St. Veronica,
made by Fra. Mochi, has over it the reliquary, where they showed us the
miraculous _Sudarium_ indued with the picture of our Savior's face, with
this inscription: "_Salvatoris imaginem Veronicæ Sudario exceptam ut loci
majestas decentèr custodiret, Urbanus VIII. Pont. Max. Marmoreum signum
et Altare addidit, Conditorium extruxit et ornavit_."

Right against this is that of Longinus, of a Colossean magnitude, also by
Bernini, and over him the conservatory of the iron lance inserted in a
most precious crystal, with this epigraph: "_Longini Lanceam quam
Innocentius VIII. à Bajazete Turcarum Tyranno accepit, Urbanus VIII.
statuâ appositâ, et Sacello substructo, in exornatum Conditorium
transtulit_."

The third chapel has over the altar the statue of our countrywoman, St.
Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great; the work of Boggi, an
excellent sculptor; and here is preserved a great piece of the pretended
wood of the holy cross, which she is said to have first detected
miraculously in the Holy Land. It was placed here by the late Pope with
this inscription: "_Partem Crucis quam Helena Imperatrix è Calvario in
Urbem adduxit, Urbanus VIII. Pont. Max. è Sissorianâ Basilicâ desumptam,
additis arâ et statuâ, hìc in Vaticano collocavit_."

The fourth hath over the altar, and opposite to that of St. Veronica, the
statue of St. Andrew, the work of Fiamingo, admirable above all the
other; above is preserved the head of that Apostle, richly enchased. It
is said that this excellent sculptor died mad to see his statue placed in
a disadvantageous light by Bernini, the chief architect, who found
himself outdone by this artist. The inscription over it is this:

    "_St. Andreæ caput quod Pius II. ex Achaiâ in Vaticanum asportandum
    curavit, Urbanus VIII. novis hic ornamentis decoratum sacrisque
    statuæ ac Sacelli honoribus coli voluit._"

The relics showed and kept in this church are without number, as are also
the precious vessels of gold, silver, and gems, with the vests and
services to be seen in the Sacristy, which they showed us. Under the high
altar is an ample grot inlaid with _pietra-commessa_, wherein half of the
bodies of St. Peter and St. Paul are preserved; before hang divers great
lamps of the richest plate, burning continually. About this and
contiguous to the altar, runs a balustrade, in form of a theater, of
black marble. Toward the left, as you go out of the church by the
portico, a little beneath the high altar, is an old brass statue of St.
Peter sitting, under the soles of whose feet many devout persons rub
their heads, and touch their chaplets. This was formerly cast from a
statue of Jupiter Capitolinus. In another place, stands a column grated
about with iron, whereon they report that our Blessed Savior was often
wont to lean as he preached in the Temple. In the work of the reliquary
under the cupola there are eight wreathed columns brought from the Temple
of Solomon. In another chapel, they showed us the chair of St. Peter, or,
as they name it, the Apostolical Throne. But among all the chapels the
one most glorious has for an altar-piece a Madonna bearing a dead Christ
on her knees, in white marble, the work of Michael Angelo. At the upper
end of the Cathedral, are several stately monuments, especially that of
Urban VIII. Round the cupola, and in many other places in the church, are
confession seats, for all languages, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish,
Italian, French, English, Irish, Welsh, Sclavonian, Dutch, etc., as it is
written on their friezes in golden capitals, and there are still at
confessions some of all nations. Toward the lower end of the church, and
on the side of a vast pillar sustaining a weighty roof, is the
_depositum_ and statue of the Countess Matilda, a rare piece, with
basso-relievos about it of white marble, the work of Bernini. Here are
also those of Sextus IV. and Paulus III., etc. Among the exquisite pieces
in this sumptuous fabric is that of the ship with St. Peter held up from
sinking by our Savior; the emblems about it are the Mosaic of the famous
Giotto, who restored and made it perfect after it had been defaced by the
Barbarians. Nor is the pavement under the cupola to be passed over
without observation, which with the rest of the body and walls of the
whole church, are all inlaid with the richest of _pietra-commessa_, in
the most splendid colors of polished marbles, agates, serpentine,
porphyry, calcedon, etc., wholly incrusted to the very roof. Coming out
by the portico at which we entered, we were shown the Porta Santa, never
opened but at the year of jubilee. This glorious foundation hath
belonging to it thirty canons, thirty-six beneficiates, twenty-eight
clerks beneficed, with innumerable chaplains, etc., a Cardinal being
always archpriest; the present Cardinal was Francisco Barberini, who also
styled himself Protector of the English, to whom he was indeed very
courteous.

20th November, 1644. I went to visit that ancient See and Cathedral of
St. John di Laterano, and the holy places thereabout. This is a church of
extraordinary devotion, though, for outward form, not comparable to St.
Peter's, being of Gothic ordonnance. Before we went into the cathedral,
the Baptistery of St. John Baptist presented itself, being formerly part
of the Great Constantine's palace, and, as it is said, his chamber where
by St. Silvester he was made a Christian. It is of an octagonal shape,
having before the entrance eight fair pillars of rich porphyry, each of
one entire piece, their capitals of divers orders, supporting lesser
columns of white marble, and these supporting a noble cupola, the molding
whereof is excellently wrought. In the chapel which they affirm to have
been the lodging place of this Emperor, all women are prohibited from
entering, for the malice of Herodias who caused him to lose his head.
Here are deposited several sacred relics of St. James, Mary Magdalen, St.
Matthew, etc., and two goodly pictures. Another chapel, or oratory near
it, is called St. John the Evangelist, well adorned with marbles and
tables, especially those of Cavaliére Giuseppe, and of Tempesta, in
fresco. We went hence into another called St. Venantius, in which is a
tribunal all of Mosaic in figures of Popes. Here is also an altar of the
Madonna, much visited, and divers Sclavonish saints, companions of Pope
John IV. The portico of the church is built of materials brought from
Pontius Pilate's house in Jerusalem.

The next sight which attracted our attention, was a wonderful concourse
of people at their devotions before a place called _Scala Sancta_, to
which is built a noble front. Entering the portico, we saw those large
marble stairs, twenty-eight in number, which are never ascended but on
the knees, some lip-devotion being used on every step; on which you may
perceive divers red specks of blood under a grate, which they affirm to
have been drops of our Blessed Savior, at the time he was so barbarously
misused by Herod's soldiers; for these stairs are reported to have been
translated hither from his palace in Jerusalem. At the top of them is a
chapel, whereat they enter (but we could not be permitted) by gates of
marble, being the same our Savior passed when he went out of Herod's
house. This they name the _Sanctum Sanctorum_, and over it we read this
epigraph:

    _Non est in toto sanctior orbe locus._

Here, through a grate, we saw that picture of Christ painted (as they
say) by the hand of St. Luke, to the life. Descending again, we saw
before the church the obelisk, which is indeed most worthy of admiration.
It formerly lay in the Circo Maximo, and was erected here by Sextus V.,
in 1587, being 112 feet in height without the base or pedestal; at the
foot nine and a half one way, and eight the other. This pillar was first
brought from Thebes at the utmost confines of Egypt, to Alexandria, from
thence to Constantinople, thence to Rome, and is said by Ammianus
Marcellinus to have been dedicated to Rameses, King of Egypt. It was
transferred to this city by Constantine the son of the Great, and is full
of hieroglyphics, serpents, men, owls, falcons, oxen, instruments, etc.,
containing (as Father Kircher the Jesuit will shortly tell us in a book
which he is ready to publish) all the recondite and abstruse learning of
that people. The vessel, galley, or float, that brought it to Rome so
many hundred leagues, must needs have been of wonderful bigness and
strange fabric. The stone is one and entire, and (having been thrown
down) was erected by the famous Dom. Fontana, for that magnificent Pope,
Sextus V., as the rest were; it is now cracked in many places, but
solidly joined. The obelisk is thus inscribed at the several faciátas:

    _Fl. Constantinus Augustus, Constantini Augusti F. Obeliscum à
    patre suo motum diuq; Alexandriæ jacentem, trecentorum remigum
    impositum navi mirandæ vastitatis per mare Tyberimq; magnis molibus
    Romam convectum in Circo Max. ponendum S.P.Q.R.D.D._

On the second square:

    _Fl. Constantinus Max: Aug: Christianæ fidei Vindex & Assertor
    Obeliscum ab Ægyptio Rege impuro voto Soli dicatum, sedibus avulsum
    suis per Nilum transfer. Alexandriam, ut Novam Romam ab se tunc
    conditam eo decoraret monumento._

On the third:

    _Sextus V. Pontifex Max: Obeliscum hunc specie eximiâ temporum
    calamitate fractum, Circi Maximi ruinis humo, limoq; altè demersum,
    multâ impensâ extraxit, hunc in locum magno labore transtulit,
    formàq; pristinâ accuratè vestitum, Cruci invictissimæ dicavit anno
    M.D.LXXXVIII. Pont. IIII._

On the fourth:

    _Constantinus per Crucem Victor à Silvestro hìc Baptizatus Crucis
    gloriam propagavit._

Leaving this wonderful monument (before which is a stately public
fountain, with a statue of St. John in the middle of it), we visited His
Holiness's palace, being a little on the left hand, the design of
Fontana, architect to Sextus V. This I take to be one of the best
palaces in Rome; but not staying we entered the church of St. John di
Laterano, which is properly the Cathedral of the Roman See, as I learned
by these verses engraven upon the architrave of the portico:

    _Dogmate Papali datur, et simul Imperiali
    Quòd sim cunctarum mater caput Ecclesiar[)u]
    Hinc Salvatoris coelestia regna datoris
    Nomine Sanxerunt, cum cuncta peracta fuerunt;
    Sic vos ex toto conversi supplice voto
    Nostra quòd hæc ædes; tibi Christe sit inclyta sedes._

It is called Lateran, from a noble family formerly dwelling it seems
hereabouts, on Mons Cælius. The church is Gothic, and hath a stately
tribunal; the paintings are of Pietro Pisano. It was the first church
that was consecrated with the ceremonies now introduced, and where altars
of stone supplied those of wood heretofore in use, and made like large
chests for the easier removal in times of persecution; such an altar is
still the great one here preserved, as being that on which (they hold)
St. Peter celebrated mass at Rome; for which reason none but the Pope may
now presume to make that use of it. The pavement is of all sorts of
precious marbles, and so are the walls to a great height, over which it
is painted _á fresco_ with the life and acts of Constantine the Great, by
most excellent masters. The organs are rare, supported by four columns.
The _soffito_ is all richly gilded, and full of pictures. Opposite to the
porta is an altar of exquisite architecture, with a tabernacle on it all
of precious stones, the work of Targoni; on this is a _coena_ of plate,
the invention of Curtius Vanni, of exceeding value; the tables hanging
over it are of Giuseppe d'Arpino. About this are four excellent columns
transported out of Asia by the Emperor Titus, of brass, double gilt,
about twelve feet in height; the walls between them are incrusted with
marble and set with statues in niches, the vacuum reported to be filled
with holy earth, which St. Helena sent from Jerusalem to her son,
Constantine, who set these pillars where they now stand. At one side of
this is an oratory full of rare paintings and monuments, especially those
of the great Connestábile Colonna. Out of this we came into the
_sacristia_, full of good pictures of Albert and others. At the end of
the church is a flat stone supported by four pillars which they affirm
to have been the exact height of our Blessed Savior, and say they never
fitted any mortal man that tried it, but he was either taller or shorter;
two columns of the veil of the Temple which rent at his passion; the
stone on which they threw lots for his seamless vesture; and the pillar
on which the cock crowed, after Peter's denial; and, to omit no fine
thing, the just length of the Virgin Mary's foot as it seems her
shoemaker affirmed! Here is a sumptuous cross, beset with precious
stones, containing some of the VERY wood of the holy cross itself; with
many other things of this sort: also numerous most magnificent monuments,
especially those of St. Helena, of porphyry; Cardinal Farneze; Martin I.,
of copper; the pictures of Mary Magdalen, Martin V., Laurentius Valla,
etc., are of Gaetano; the Nunciata, designed by M. Angelo; and the great
crucifix of Sermoneta. In a chapel at one end of the porch is a statue of
Henry IV. of France, in brass, standing in a dark hole, and so has done
many years; perhaps from not believing him a thorough proselyte. The two
famous Oecumenical Councils were celebrated in this Church by Pope
Simachus, Martin I., Stephen, etc.

Leaving this venerable church (for in truth it has a certain majesty in
it), we passed through a fair and large hospital of good architecture,
having some inscriptions put up by Barberini, the late Pope's nephew. We
then went by St. Sylvia, where is a noble statue of St. Gregory P., begun
by M. Angelo; a St. Andrew, and the bath of St. Cecilia. In this church
are some rare paintings, especially that story on the wall of Guido Reni.
Thence to St. Giovanni e Paula, where the friars are reputed to be great
chemists. The choir, roof, and paintings in the _tribuna_ are excellent.

Descending the Mons Cælius, we came against the vestiges of the Palazzo
Maggiore, heretofore the Golden House of Nero; now nothing but a heap of
vast and confused ruins, to show what time and the vicissitude of human
things does change from the most glorious and magnificent to the most
deformed and confused. We next went into St. Sebastian's Church, which
has a handsome front: then we passed by the place where Romulus and Remus
were taken up by Faustulus, the Forum Romanum, and so by the edge of the
Mons Palatinus; where we saw the ruins of Pompey's house, and the Church
of St. Anacletus; and so into the Circus Maximus, heretofore capable of
containing a hundred and sixty thousand spectators, but now all one
entire heap of rubbish, part of it converted into a garden of pot herbs.
We concluded this evening with hearing the rare voices and music at the
Chiesa Nova.

21st November, 1644. I was carried to see a great virtuoso, Cavaliéro
Pozzo, who showed us a rare collection of all kind of antiquities, and a
choice library, over which are the effigies of most of our late men of
polite literature. He had a great collection of the antique
basso-relievos about Rome, which this curious man had caused to be
designed in several folios: many fine medals; the stone which Pliny calls
Enhydros; it had plainly in it the quantity of half a spoonful of water,
of a yellow pebble color, of the bigness of a walnut. A stone paler than
an amethyst, which yet he affirmed to be the true carbuncle, and harder
than a diamond; it was set in a ring, without foil, or anything at the
bottom, so as it was transparent, of a greenish yellow, more lustrous
than a diamond. He had very pretty things painted on crimson velvet,
designed in black, and shaded and heightened with white, set in frames;
also a number of choice designs and drawings.

Hence we walked to the Suburra and Ærarium Saturni, where yet remain some
ruins and an inscription. From thence to St. Pietro _in vinculis_, one of
the seven churches on the Esquiline, an old and much-frequented place of
great devotion for the relics there, especially the bodies of the seven
Maccabean brethren, which lie under the altar. On the wall is a St.
Sebastian, of mosaic, after the Greek manner: but what I chiefly regarded
was, that noble sepulchre of Pope Julius II., the work of M. Angelo; with
that never-sufficiently-to-be-admired statue of Moses, in white marble,
and those of Vita Contemplativa and Activa, by the same incomparable
hand. To this church belongs a monastery, in the court of whose cloisters
grow two tall and very stately palm trees. Behind these, we walked a turn
among the Baths of Titus, admiring the strange and prodigious receptacles
for water, which the vulgar call the Setti Sali, now all in heaps.

22d November, 1644. Was the solemn and greatest ceremony of all the State
Ecclesiastical, viz, the procession of the Pope (Innocent X.) to St. John
di Laterano, which, standing on the steps of Ara Celi, near the Capitol,
I saw pass in this manner:--First went a guard of Switzers to make way,
and divers of the avant guard of horse carrying lances. Next followed
those who carried the robes of the Cardinals, two and two; then the
Cardinal's mace bearers; the caudatari, on mules; the masters of their
horse; the Pope's barber, tailor, baker, gardener, and other domestic
officers, all on horseback, in rich liveries; the squires belonging to
the Guard; five men in rich liveries led five noble Neapolitan horses,
white as snow, covered to the ground with trappings richly embroidered;
which is a service paid by the King of Spain for the kingdoms of Naples
and Sicily, pretended feudatories to the Pope; three mules of exquisite
beauty and price, trapped in crimson velvet; next followed three rich
litters with mules, the litters empty; the master of the horse alone,
with his squires; five trumpeters; the _armerieri estra muros_; the
fiscal and consistorial advocates; _capellani_, _camerieri de honore_,
_cubiculari_ and chamberlains, called _secreti_.

Then followed four other _camerieri_ with four caps of the
dignity-pontifical, which were Cardinals' hats carried on staves; four
trumpets; after them a number of noble Romans and gentlemen of quality,
very rich, and followed by innumerable _staffiéri_ and pages; the
secretaries of the _chancellaria_, _abbreviatori-accoliti_ in their long
robes, and on mules; _auditori di rota_; the dean of the _rôti_ and
master of the sacred palace, on mules, with grave but rich footclothes,
and in flat episcopal hats; then went more of the Roman and other
nobility and courtiers, with divers pages in most rich liveries on
horseback; fourteen drums belonging to the Capitol; the marshals with
their staves; the two syndics; the conservators of the city, in robes of
crimson damask; the knight-gonfalonier and prior of the R. R., in velvet
toques; six of his Holiness's mace bearers; then the captain, or
governor, of the Castle of St. Angelo, upon a brave prancer; the governor
of the city; on both sides of these two long ranks of Switzers, the
masters of the ceremonies; the cross bearer on horseback, with two
priests at each hand on foot; pages, footmen, and guards, in abundance.
Then came the Pope himself, carried in a litter, or rather open chair, of
crimson velvet, richly embroidered, and borne by two stately mules; as he
went he held up two fingers, blessing the multitude who were on their
knees, or looking out of their windows and houses, with loud _vivas_ and
acclamations of felicity to their new Prince. This chair was followed by
the master of his chamber, cup bearer, secretary, and physician; then
came the Cardinal-Bishops, Cardinal-Priests, Cardinal-Deacons,
Patriarchs, Archbishops, and Bishops, all in their several and distinct
habits, some in red, others in green flat hats with tassels, all on
gallant mules richly trapped with velvet, and led by their servants in
great state and multitudes; after them, the apostolical protonotary,
auditor, treasurer, and referendaries; lastly, the trumpets of the rear
guard, two pages of arms in helmets with feathers, and carrying lances;
two captains; the pontifical standard of the Church; the two _alfieri_,
or cornets, of the Pope's light horse, who all followed in armor and
carrying lances; which, with innumerable rich coaches, litters, and
people, made up the procession. What they did at St. John di Laterano, I
could not see, by reason of the prodigious crowd; so I spent most of the
day in viewing the two triumphal arches which had been purposely erected
a few days before, and till now covered; the one by the Duke of Parma, in
the Foro Romano, the other by the Jews in the Capitol, with flattering
inscriptions. They were of excellent architecture, decorated with statues
and abundance of ornaments proper for the occasion, since they were but
temporary, and made up of boards, cloth, etc., painted and framed on the
sudden, but as to outward appearance, solid and very stately. The night
ended with fireworks. What I saw was that which was built before the
Spanish Ambassador's house, in the Piazza del Trinita, and another,
before that of the French. The first appeared to be a mighty rock,
bearing the Pope's Arms, a dragon, and divers figures, which being set on
fire by one who flung a rocket at it, kindled immediately, yet preserving
the figure both of the rock and statues a very long time; insomuch as it
was deemed ten thousand reports of squibs and crackers spent themselves
in order. That before the French Ambassador's Palace was a Diana drawn
in a chariot by her dogs, with abundance of other figures as large as the
life, which played with fire in the same manner. In the meantime, the
windows of the whole city were set with tapers put into lanterns, or
sconces, of several colored oiled paper, that the wind might not annoy
them; this rendered a most glorious show. Besides these, there were at
least twenty other fireworks of vast charge and rare art for their
invention before divers Ambassadors, Princes, and Cardinals' Palaces,
especially that on the Castle of St. Angelo, being a pyramid of lights,
of great height, fastened to the ropes and cables which support the
standard pole. The streets were this night as light as day, full of
bonfires, cannon roaring, music playing, fountains running wine, in all
excess of joy and triumph.

23d November, 1644. I went to the Jesuits' College again, the front
whereof gives place to few for its architecture, most of its ornaments
being of rich marble. It has within a noble portico and court, sustained
by stately columns, as is the corridor over the portico, at the sides of
which are the schools for arts and sciences, which are here taught as at
the University. Here I heard Father Athanasius Kircher upon a part of
Euclid, which he expounded. To this joins a glorious and ample church for
the students; a second is not fully finished; and there are two noble
libraries, where I was showed that famous wit and historian, Famianus
Strada. Hence we went to the house of Hippolito Vitellesco (afterward
bibliothecary of the Vatican library), who showed us one of the best
collections of statues in Rome, to which he frequently talks as if they
were living, pronouncing now and then orations, sentences, and verses,
sometimes kissing and embracing them. He has a head of Brutus scarred in
the face by order of the Senate for killing Julius; this is much
esteemed. Also a Minerva, and others of great value. This gentleman not
long since purchased land in the kingdom of Naples, in hope, by digging
the ground, to find more statues; which it seems so far succeeded, as to
be much more worth than the purchase. We spent the evening at the Chiesa
Nova, where was excellent music; but, before that began, the courteous
fathers led me into a nobly furnished library, contiguous to their most
beautiful convent.

28th November, 1644. I went to see the garden and house of the
Aldobrandini, now Cardinal Borghese's. This palace is, for architecture,
magnificence, pomp, and state, one of the most considerable about the
city. It has four fronts, and a noble piazza before it. Within the
courts, under arches supported by marble columns, are many excellent
statues. Ascending the stairs, there is a rare figure of Diana, of white
marble. The St. Sebastian and Hermaphrodite are of stupendous art. For
paintings, our Savior's Head, by Correggio; several pieces of Raphael,
some of which are small; some of Bassano Veronese; the Leda, and two
admirable Venuses, are of Titian's pencil; so is the Psyche and Cupid;
the head of St. John, borne by Herodias; two heads of Albert Durer, very
exquisite. We were shown here a fine cabinet and tables of Florence work
in stone. In the gardens are many fine fountains, the walls covered with
citron trees, which, being rarely spread, invest the stone work entirely;
and, toward the street, at a back gate, the port is so handsomely clothed
with ivy as much pleased me. About this palace are many noble antique
bassi-relievi: two especially are placed on the ground, representing
armor, and other military furniture of the Romans; beside these, stand
about the garden numerous rare statues, altars, and urns. Above all for
antiquity and curiosity (as being the only rarity of that nature now
known to remain) is that piece of old Roman painting representing the
Roman _Sponsalia_, or celebration of their marriage, judged to be 1,400
years old, yet are the colors very lively, and the design very entire,
though found deep in the ground. For this morsel of painting's sake only,
it is said the Borghesi purchased the house, because this being on a wall
in a kind of banqueting house in the garden, could not be removed, but
passes with the inheritance.

29th November, 1644. I a second time visited the Medicean Palace, being
near my lodging, the more exactly to have a view of the noble collections
that adorn it, especially the bassi-relievi and antique friezes inserted
about the stone work of the house. The Saturn, of metal, standing in the
portico, is a rare piece; so is the Jupiter and Apollo, in the hall. We
were now led into those rooms above we could not see before, full of
incomparable statues and antiquities; above all, and haply preferable to
any in the world, are the Two Wrestlers, for the inextricable mixture
with each other's arms and legs is stupendous. In the great chamber is
the Gladiator, whetting a knife; but the Venus is without parallel, being
the masterpiece of one whose name you see graven under it in old Greek
characters; nothing in sculpture ever approached this miracle of art. To
this add Marcius, Ganymede, a little Apollo playing on a pipe; some
relievi incrusted on the palace-walls; and an antique _vas_ of marble,
near six feet high. Among the pictures may be mentioned the Magdalen and
St. Peter, weeping. I pass over the cabinets and tables of _pietra
commessa_, being the proper invention of the Florentines. In one of the
chambers is a whimsical chair, which folded into so many varieties, as to
turn into a bed, a bolster, a table, or a couch. I had another walk in
the garden, where are two huge vases, or baths of stone.

I went further up the hill to the Pope's Palaces at Monte Cavallo, where
I now saw the garden more exactly, and found it to be one of the most
magnificent and pleasant in Rome. I am told the gardener is annually
allowed 2,000 _scudi_ for the keeping of it. Here I observed hedges of
myrtle above a man's height; others of laurel, oranges, nay, of ivy and
juniper; the close walks, and rustic grotto; a crypt, of which the laver,
or basin, is of one vast, entire, antique porphyry, and below this flows
a plentiful cascade; the steps of the grotto and the roofs being of rich
Mosaic. Here are hydraulic organs, a fish pond, and an ample bath. From
hence, we went to taste some rare Greco; and so home.

Being now pretty weary of continual walking, I kept within, for the most
part, till the 6th of December; and, during this time, I entertained one
Signor Alessandro, who gave me some lessons on the theorbo.

The next excursion was over the Tiber, which I crossed in a ferry-boat,
to see the Palazzo di Ghisi, standing in Transtevere, fairly built, but
famous only for the painting _á fresco_ on the _volto_ of the portico
toward the garden; the story is the Amours of Cupid and Psyche, by the
hand of the celebrated Raphael d'Urbino. Here you always see painters
designing and copying after it, being esteemed one of the rarest pieces
of that art in the world; and with great reason. I must not omit that
incomparable table of Galatea (as I remember), so carefully preserved in
the cupboard at one of the ends of this walk, to protect it from the air,
being a most lively painting. There are likewise excellent things of
Baldassare, and others.

Thence we went to the noble house of the Duke of Bracciano, fairly built,
with a stately court and fountain.

Next, we walked to St. Mary's Church, where was the _Taberna Meritoria_,
where the old Roman soldiers received their triumphal garland, which they
ever after wore. The high altar is very fair, adorned with columns of
porphyry: here is also some mosaic work about the choir, and the
Assumption is an esteemed piece. It is said that this church was the
first that was dedicated to the Virgin at Rome. In the opposite piazza is
a very sumptuous fountain.

12th December, 1644. I went again to St. Peter's to see the chapels,
churches, and grots under the whole church (like our St. Faith's under
Paul's), in which lie interred a multitude of Saints, Martyrs, and Popes;
among them our countryman, Adrian IV., (Nicholas Brekespere) in a chest
of porphyry; Sir J. Chrysostom; Petronella; the heads of St. James minor,
St. Luke, St. Sebastian, and our Thomas à Becket; a shoulder of St.
Christopher; an arm of Joseph of Arimathea; Longinus; besides 134 more
bishops, soldiers, princes, scholars, cardinals, kings, emperors, their
wives; too long to particularize.

Hence we walked into the cemetery, called Campo Santo, the earth
consisting of several ship-loads of mold, transported from Jerusalem,
which consumes a carcass in twenty-four hours. To this joins that rare
hospital, where once was Nero's circus; the next to this is the
Inquisition-house and prison, the inside whereof, I thank God, I was not
curious to see. To this joins His Holiness's Horseguards.

On Christmas-eve, I went not to bed, being desirous of seeing the many
extraordinary ceremonies performed then in their churches, at midnight
masses and sermons. I walked from church to church the whole night in
admiration at the multitude of scenes and pageantry which the friars had
with much industry and craft set out, to catch the devout women and
superstitious sort of people, who never parted without dropping some
money into a vessel set on purpose; but especially observable was the
puppetry in the Church of the Minerva, representing the Nativity. I
thence went and heard a sermon at the Apollinare; by which time it was
morning. On Christmas-day his Holiness sang mass, the artillery of St.
Angelo went off, and all this day was exposed the cradle of our Lord.

29th December, 1644. We were invited by the English Jesuits to dinner,
being their great feast of Thomas [à Becket] of Canterbury. We dined in
their common refectory, and afterward saw an Italian comedy acted by
their alumni before the Cardinals.

January, 1645. We saw pass the new officers of the people of Rome;
especially, for their noble habits were most conspicuous, the three
Consuls, now called Conservators, who take their places in the Capitol,
having been sworn the day before between the hands of the Pope. We ended
the day with the rare music at the Chiesa Nova.

6th January, 1645. Was the ceremony of our Savior's baptism in the Church
of St. Athanasius, and at Ara Celi was a great procession, del Bambino,
as they call it, where were all the magistrates, and a wonderful
concourse of people.

7th January, 1645. A sermon was preached to the Jews, at Ponte Sisto, who
are constrained to sit till the hour is done; but it is with so much
malice in their countenances, spitting, humming, coughing, and motion,
that it is almost impossible they should hear a word from the preacher. A
conversion is very rare.

14th January, 1645. The heads of St. Peter and St. Paul are exposed at
St. John Laterano.

15th January, 1645. The zitelle, or young wenches, which are to have
portions given them by the Pope, being poor, and to marry them, walked in
procession to St. Peter's, where the Veronica was shown.

I went to the Ghetto, where the Jews dwell as in a suburb by themselves;
being invited by a Jew of my acquaintance to see a circumcision. I passed
by the Piazza Judea, where their seraglio begins; for, being environed
with walls, they are locked up every night. In this place remains yet
part of a stately fabric, which my Jew told me had been a palace of
theirs for the ambassador of their nation, when their country was subject
to the Romans. Being led through the Synagogue into a private house, I
found a world of people in a chamber: by and by came an old man, who
prepared and laid in order divers instruments brought by a little child
of about seven years old in a box. These the man laid in a silver basin;
the knife was much like a short razor to shut into the half. Then they
burnt some incense in a censer, which perfumed the room all the while the
ceremony was performing. In the basin was a little cap made of white
paper like a capuchin's hood, not bigger than the finger: also a paper of
a red astringent powder, I suppose of bole; a small instrument of silver,
cleft in the middle at one end, to take up the prepuce withal; a fine
linen cloth wrapped up. These being all in order, the women brought the
infant swaddled, out of another chamber, and delivered it to the Rabbi,
who carried and presented it before an altar, or cupboard, dressed up, on
which lay the five Books of Moses, and the Commandments, a little
unrolled. Before this, with profound reverence, and mumbling a few words,
he waved the child to and fro awhile; then he delivered it to another
Rabbi, who sat all this time upon a table. While the ceremony was
performing, all the company fell singing a Hebrew hymn, in a barbarous
tone, waving themselves to and fro; a ceremony they observe in all their
devotions.--The Jews in Rome all wear yellow hats, live only upon brokage
and usury, very poor and despicable, beyond what they are in other
territories of Princes where they are permitted.

18th January, 1645. I went to see the Pope's Palace, the Vatican, where
he for the most part keeps his Court. It was first built by Pope
Symmachus, and since augmented to a vast pile of building by his
successors. That part of it added by Sextus V. is most magnificent. This
leads us into divers terraces arched _sub dio_, painted by Raphael with
the histories of the Bible, so esteemed, that artists come from all parts
of Europe to make their studies from these designs. The foliage and
grotesque about some of the compartments are admirable. In another room
are represented at large, maps and plots of most countries in the world,
in vast tables, with brief descriptions. The stairs which ascend out of
St. Peter's portico into the first hall, are rarely contrived for ease;
these lead into the hall of Gregory XIII., the walls whereof, half way to
the roof, are incrusted with most precious marbles of various colors and
works. So is also the pavement inlaid work; but what exceeds description
is, the _volta_, or roof itself, which is so exquisitely painted, that it
is almost impossible for the skillfullest eyes to discern whether it be
the work of the pencil upon a flat, or of a tool cut deep in stone. The
_Rota dentata_, in this admirable perspective, on the left hand as one
goes out, the _Setella_, etc., are things of art incomparable. Certainly
this is one of the most superb and royal apartments in the world, much
too beautiful for a guard of gigantic Switzers, who do nothing but drink
and play at cards in it. Going up these stairs is a painting of St.
Peter, walking on the sea toward our Savior.

Out of this I went into another hall, just before the chapel, called the
Sàla del Conclave, full of admirable paintings; among others is the
Assassination of Coligni, the great [Protestant] French Admiral, murdered
by the Duke of Guise, in the Parisian massacre at the nuptials of Henry
IV, with Queen Margaret; under it is written, "_Coligni et sociorum
cædes_:" on the other side, "_Rex Coligi necem probat_."

There is another very large picture, under which is inscribed:

    "_Alexander Papa III., Frederici Primi Imperatoris iram et impetum
    fugiens, abdidit se Venetijs; cognitum et à senatu perhonorificè
    susceptum, Othone Imperatoris filio navali prælio victo captoq;
    Fredericus, pace facta, supplex adorat; fidem et obedientiam
    pollicitus. Ita Pontifici sua dignitas Venet. Reip. beneficio
    restituta MCLXXVIII._"[24]

        [Footnote 24: Pope Alexander III., flying from the wrath and
        violence of the Emperor Frederick I., took shelter at Venice,
        where he was acknowledged, and most honorably received by the
        Senate. The Emperor's son, Otho, being conquered and taken in
        a naval battle, the Emperor, having made peace, became a
        suppliant to the Pope, promising fealty and obedience. Thus
        his dignity was restored to the Pontiff, by the aid of the
        Republic of Venice, MCLXXVIII.]

This inscription I the rather took notice of, because Urban VIII. had
caused it to be blotted out during the difference between him and that
State; but it was now restored and refreshed by his successor, to the
great honor of the Venetians. The Battle of Lepanto is another fair
piece here.

Now we came into the Pope's chapel, so much celebrated for the Last
Judgment painted by M. Angelo Buonarotti. It is a painting in fresco,
upon a dead wall at the upper end of the chapel, just over the high
altar, of a vast design and miraculous fancy, considering the multitude
of naked figures and variety of posture. The roof also is full of rare
work. Hence, we went into the _sacristia_ where were showed all the most
precious vestments, copes, and furniture of the chapel. One priestly
cope, with the whole suite, had been sent from one of our English Henrys,
and is shown for a great rarity. There were divers of the Pope's
pantoufles that are kissed on his foot, having rich jewels embroidered on
the instep, covered with crimson velvet; also his tiara, or triple crown,
divers miters, crosiers, etc., all bestudded with precious stones, gold,
and pearl, to a very great value; a very large cross, carved (as they
affirm) out of the holy wood itself; numerous utensils of crystal, gold,
agate, amber, and other costly materials for the altar.

We then went into those chambers painted with the Histories of the
burning of Rome, quenched by the procession of a Crucifix; the victory of
Constantine over Maxentius; St. Peter's delivery out of Prison; all by
Julio Romano, and are therefore called the Painters' Academy, because you
always find some young men or other designing from them: a civility which
is not refused in Italy, where any rare pieces of the old and best
masters are extant, and which is the occasion of breeding up many
excellent men in that profession.

The Sala Clementina's Suffito is painted by Cherubin Alberti, with an
ample landscape of Paul Bril's.

We were then conducted into a new gallery, whose sides were painted with
views of the most famous places, towns, and territories in Italy, rarely
done, and upon the roof the chief Acts of the Roman Church since St.
Peter's pretended See there. It is doubtless one of the most magnificent
galleries in Europe.--Out of this we came into the Consistory, a noble
room, the _volta_ painted in grotesque, as I remember. At the upper end,
is an elevated throne and a baldachin, or canopy of state, for his
Holiness, over it.

From thence, through a very long gallery (longer, I think, than the
French Kings at the Louvre), but only of bare walls, we were brought into
the Vatican Library. This passage was now full of poor people, to each of
whom, in his passage to St. Peter's, the Pope gave a _mezzo grosse_. I
believe they were in number near 1,500 or 2,000 persons.

This library is the most nobly built, furnished, and beautified of any in
the world; ample, stately, light, and cheerful, looking into a most
pleasant garden. The walls and roof are painted, not with antiques and
grotesques, like our Bodleian at Oxford, but emblems, figures, diagrams,
and the like learned inventions, found out by the wit and industry of
famous men, of which there are now whole volumes extant. There were
likewise the effigies of the most illustrious men of letters and fathers
of the church, with divers noble statues, in white marble, at the
entrance, viz, Hippolytus and Aristides. The General Councils are
painted on the side walls. As to the ranging of the books, they are all
shut up in presses of wainscot, and not exposed on shelves to the open
air, nor are the most precious mixed among the more ordinary, which are
showed to the curious only; such are those two Virgils written on
parchment, of more than a thousand years old; the like, a Terence; the
"Acts of the Apostles" in golden capital letters; Petrarch's "Epigrams,"
written with his own hand; also a Hebrew parchment, made up in the
ancient manner, from whence they were first called "_Volumina_", with the
Cornua; but what we English do much inquire after, the book which our
Henry VIII. writ against Luther.[25]

    [Footnote 25: This very book, by one of those curious chances that
    occasionally happen, found its way into England some forty years
    ago, and was seen by the Editor of the early edition of this
    "Diary." It may be worth remarking that wherever, in the course of
    it, the title of "Defender of the Faith" was subjoined to the name
    of Henry, the Pope had drawn his pen through the title. The name of
    the King occurred in his own handwriting both at the beginning and
    end; and on the binding were the Royal Arms. Its possessor had
    purchased it in Italy for a few shillings from an old bookstall.]

The largest room is 100 paces long; at the end is the gallery of printed
books; then the gallery of the Duke of Urban's library, in which are MSS.
of remarkable miniature, and divers Chinese, Mexican, Samaritan,
Abyssinian, and other oriental books.

In another wing of the edifice, 200 paces long, were all the books taken
from Heidelberg, of which the learned Gruter, and other great scholars,
had been keepers. These walls and _volte_ are painted with
representations of the machines invented by Domenico Fontana for erection
of the obelisks; and the true design of Mahomet's sepulchre at Mecca.

Out of this we went to see the Conclave, where, during a vacancy, the
Cardinals are shut up till they are agreed upon a new election; the whole
manner whereof was described to us.

Hence we went into the Pope's Armory, under the library. Over the door is
this inscription:

    "URBANUS VIII. LITTERIS ARMA, ARMA LITTERIS."

I hardly believe any prince in Europe is able to show a more completely
furnished library of Mars, for the quality and quantity, which is 40,000
complete for horse and foot, and neatly kept. Out of this we passed again
by the long gallery, and at the lower end of it down a very large pair of
stairs, round, without any steps as usually, but descending with an
evenness so ample and easy, that a horse-litter, or coach, may with ease
be drawn up; the sides of the vacuity are set with columns: those at
Amboise, on the Loire, in France, are something of this invention, but
nothing so spruce. By these, we descended into the Vatican gardens,
called Belvedere, where entering first into a kind of court, we were
showed those incomparable statues (so famed by Pliny and others) of
Laocoon with his three sons embraced by a huge serpent, all of one entire
Parian stone, very white and perfect, somewhat bigger than the life, the
work of those three celebrated sculptors, Agesandrus, Polydorus, and
Artemidorus, Rhodians; it was found among the ruins of Titus's baths, and
placed here. Pliny says this statue is to be esteemed before all pictures
and statues in the world; and I am of his opinion, for I never beheld
anything of art approach it. Here are also those two famous images of
Nilus with the children playing about him, and that of Tiber; Romulus and
Remus with the Wolf; the dying Cleopatra; the Venus and Cupid, rare
pieces; the Mercury; Cybel; Hercules; Apollo; Antinous: most of which
are, for defense against the weather, shut up in niches with wainscot
doors. We were likewise showed the relics of the Hadrian Moles, viz, the
Pine, a vast piece of metal which stood on the summit of that mausoleum;
also a peacock of copper, supposed to have been part of Scipio's
monument.

In the garden without this (which contains a vast circuit of ground) are
many stately fountains, especially two casting water into antique lavers,
brought from Titus's baths; some fair grots and water-works, that noble
cascade where the ship dances, with divers other pleasant inventions,
walks, terraces, meanders, fruit trees, and a most goodly prospect over
the greatest part of the city. One fountain under the gate I must not
omit, consisting of three jettos of water gushing out of the mouths or
proboscides of bees (the arms of the late Pope), because of the
inscription:

    "_Quid miraris Apem, quae mel de floribus haurit?
    Si tibi mellitam gutture fundit aquam._"

23d January, 1645. We went without the walls of the city to visit St.
Paul's, to which place it is said the Apostle bore his own head after
Nero had caused it to be cut off. The church was founded by the great
Constantine; the main roof is supported by 100 vast columns of marble,
and the Mosaic work of the great arch is wrought with a very ancient
story A^o 440; as is likewise that of the _facciata_. The gates are
brass, made at Constantinopole in 1070, as you may read by those Greek
verses engraven on them. The church is near 500 feet long and 258 in
breadth, and has five great aisles joined to it, on the basis of one of
whose columns is this odd title: "_Fl. Eugenius Asellus C. C. Præf. Urbis
V. S. I. reparavit_." Here they showed us that miraculous Crucifix which
they say spake to St. Bridget: and, just before the Ciborio, stand two
excellent statues. Here are buried part of the bodies of St. Paul and St.
Peter. The pavement is richly interwoven with precious Oriental marbles
about the high altar, where are also four excellent paintings, whereof
one, representing the stoning of St. Stephen, is by the hand of a
Bolognian lady, named Lavinia. The tabernacle on this altar is of
excellent architecture, and the pictures in the Chapel del Sacramento
are of Lanfranco. Divers other relics there be also in this venerable
church, as a part of St. Anna; the head of the Woman of Samaria; the
chain which bound St. Paul, and the _eculeus_ used in tormenting the
primitive Christians. The church stands in the Via Ositensis, about a
mile from the walls of the city, separated from many buildings near it
except the Trie Fontana, to which (leaving our coach) we walked, going
over the mountain or little rising, upon which story says a hundred
seventy and four thousand Christians had been martyred by Maximianus,
Dioclesian, and other bloody tyrants. On this stand St. Vincent's and St.
Anastasius; likewise the Church of St. Maria Scala del Cielo, in whose
Tribuna is a very fair Mosaic work. The Church of the Trie Fontana (as
they are called) is perfectly well built, though but small (whereas that
of St. Paul is but Gothic), having a noble cupola in the middle; in this
they show the pillar to which St. Paul was bound, when his head was cut
off, and from whence it made three prodigious leaps, where there
immediately broke out the three remaining fountains, which give
denomination to this church. The waters are reported to be medicinal:
over each is erected an altar and a chained ladle, for better tasting of
the waters. That most excellent picture of St. Peter's Crucifixion is of
Guido.

25th January, 1645. I went again to the Palazzo Farnese, to see some
certain statues and antiquities which, by reason of the Major-Domo not
being within, I could not formerly obtain. In the hall stands that
triumphant Colosse of one of the family, upon three figures, a modern,
but rare piece. About it stood some Gladiators; and, at the entrance into
one of the first chambers, are two cumbent figures of AGE and YOUTH,
brought hither from St. Peter's to make room for the Longinus under the
cupola. Here was the statue of a ram running at a man on horseback, a
most incomparable expression of Fury, cut in stone; and a table of
_pietra-commessa_, very curious. The next chamber was all painted _a
fresco_, by a rare hand, as was the carving in wood of the ceiling,
which, as I remember, was in cedar, as the Italian mode is, and not poor
plaster, as ours are; some of them most richly gilt. In a third room,
stood the famous Venus, and the child Hercules strangling a serpent, of
Corinthian brass, antique, on a very curious basso-relievo; the
sacrifice to Priapus; the Egyptian Isis, in the hard, black ophite stone,
taken out of the Pantheon, greatly celebrated by the antiquaries:
likewise two tables of brass, containing divers old Roman laws. At
another side of this chamber, was the statue of a wounded Amazon falling
from her horse, worthy the name of the excellent sculptor, whoever the
artist was. Near this was a bass-relievo of a Bacchanalia, with a most
curious Silenus. The fourth room was totally environed with statues;
especially observable was that so renowned piece of a Venus looking
backward over her shoulder, and divers other naked figures, by the old
Greek masters. Over the doors are two Venuses, one of them looking on her
face in a glass, by M. Angelo; the other is painted by Caracci. I never
saw finer faces, especially that under the mask, whose beauty and art are
not to be described by words. The next chamber is also full of statues;
most of them the heads of Philosophers, very antique. One of the Cæsars
and another of Hannibal cost 1,200 crowns. Now I had a second view of
that never-to-be-sufficiently-admired gallery, painted in deep relievo,
the work of ten years' study, for a trifling reward. In the wardrobe
above they showed us fine wrought plate, porcelain, mazers of beaten and
solid gold, set with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds; a treasure,
especially the workmanship considered, of inestimable value. This is all
the Duke of Parma's. Nothing seemed to be more curious and rare in its
kind than the complete service of the purest crystal, for the altar of
the chapel, the very bell, cover of a book, sprinkler, etc., were all of
the rock, incomparably sculptured, with the holy story in deep Levati;
thus was also wrought the crucifix, chalice, vases, flowerpots, the
largest and purest crystal that my eyes ever beheld. Truly I looked on
this as one of the greatest curiosities I had seen in Rome. In another
part were presses furnished with antique arms, German clocks, perpetual
motions, watches, and curiosities of Indian works. A very ancient picture
of Pope Eugenius; a St. Bernard; and a head of marble found long since,
supposed to be a true portrait of our Blessed Savior's face.

Hence, we went to see Dr. Gibbs, a famous poet and countryman of ours,
who had some intendency in an hospital built on the Via Triumphalis,
called Christ's Hospital, which he showed us. The Infirmatory, where the
sick lay, was paved with various colored marbles, and the walls hung with
noble pieces; the beds are very fair; in the middle is a stately cupola,
under which is an altar decked with divers marble statues, all in sight
of the sick, who may both see and hear mass, as they lie in their beds.
The organs are very fine, and frequently played on to recreate the people
in pain. To this joins an apartment destined for the orphans; and there
is a school: the children wear blue, like ours in London, at an hospital
of the same appellation. Here are forty nurses, who give suck to such
children as are accidentally found exposed and abandoned. In another
quarter, are children of a bigger growth, 450 in number, who are taught
letters. In another, 500 girls, under the tuition of divers religious
matrons, in a monastery, as it were, by itself. I was assured there were
at least 2,000 more maintained in other places. I think one apartment had
in it near 1,000 beds; these are in a very long room, having an inner
passage for those who attend, with as much care, sweetness, and
conveniency as can be imagined, the Italians being generally very neat.
Under the portico, the sick may walk out and take the air. Opposite to
this, are other chambers for such as are sick of maladies of a more rare
and difficult cure, and they have rooms apart. At the end of the long
corridor is an apothecary's shop, fair and very well stored; near which
are chambers for persons of better quality, who are yet necessitous.
Whatever the poor bring is, at their coming in, delivered to a treasurer,
who makes an inventory, and is accountable to them, or their
representatives if they die.

To this building joins the house of the commendator, who, with his
officers attending the sick, make up ninety persons; besides a convent
and an ample church for the friars and priests who daily attend. The
church is extremely neat, and the _sacristia_ is very rich. Indeed it is
altogether one of the most pious and worthy foundations I ever saw. Nor
is the benefit small which divers young physicians and chirurgeons reap
by the experience they learn here among the sick, to whom those students
have free access. Hence, we ascended a very steep hill, near the Port St.
Pancratio, to that stately fountain called Acqua Paula, being the
aqueduct which Augustus had brought to Rome, now re-edified by Paulus V.;
a rare piece of architecture, and which serves the city after a journey
of thirty-five miles, here pouring itself into divers ample lavers, out
of the mouths of swans and dragons, the arms of this Pope. Situate on a
very high mount, it makes a most glorious show to the city, especially
when the sun darts on the water as it gusheth out. The inscriptions on it
are:

    "_Paulus V. Romanus Pontifex Opt. Max. Aquæductus ab Augusto Cæsare
    extructos, ævi longinquâ vetustate collapsos, in ampliorem formam
    restituit anno salutis M.D.CIX. Pont. V._"

And toward the fields:

    "_Paulus V. Rom. Pontifex Optimus Maximus, priori ductu longissimi
    temporis injuriâ penè diruto, sublimiorem._"

       *       *       *       *       *

    [One or more leaves are here wanting in Evelyn's MS., descriptive of
    other parts of Rome, and of his leaving the city.]

Thence to Velletri, a town heretofore of the Volsci, where is a public
and fair statue of P. Urban VIII., in brass, and a stately fountain in
the street. Here we lay and drank excellent wine.

28th January, 1645. We dined at Sermonetta, descending all this morning
down a stony mountain, unpleasant, yet full of olive trees; and, anon,
pass a tower built on a rock, kept by a small guard against the banditti
who infest those parts, daily robbing and killing passengers, as my Lord
Banbury and his company found to their cost a little before. To this
guard we gave some money, and so were suffered to pass, which was still
on the Appian to the _Tres Tabernæ_ (whither the brethren came from Rome
to meet St. Paul, Acts, c. 28); the ruins whereof are yet very fair,
resembling the remainder of some considerable edifice, as may be judged
by the vast stones and fairness of the arched work. The country
environing this passage is hilly, but rich; on the right hand stretches
an ample plain, being the _Pomptini Campi_. We reposed this night at
Piperno, in the posthouse without the town; and here I was extremely
troubled with a sore hand, which now began to fester, from a mischance at
Rome, upon my base, unlucky, stiff-necked, trotting, carrion mule; which
are the most wretched beasts in the world. In this town was the poet
Virgil's Camilla born.

The day following, we were fain to hire a strong convoy of about thirty
firelocks, to guard us through the cork woods (much infested with the
banditti) as far as Fossa Nuova, where was the Forum Appii, and now
stands a church with a great monastery, the place where Thomas Aquinas
both studied and lies buried. Here we all alighted, and were most
courteously received by the Monks, who showed us many relics of their
learned Saint and at the high altar the print forsooth of the mule's hoof
which he caused to kneel before the Host. The church is old, built after
the Gothic manner; but the place is very agreeably melancholy. After
this, pursuing the same noble [Appian] way (which we had before left a
little), we found it to stretch from Capua to Rome itself, and afterward
as far as Brundusium. It was built by that famous Consul, twenty-five
feet broad, every twelve feet something ascending for the ease and firmer
footing of horse and man; both the sides are also a little raised for
those who travel on foot. The whole is paved with a kind of beach-stone,
and, as I said, ever and anon adorned with some old ruin, sepulchre, or
broken statue. In one of these monuments Pancirollus tells us that, in
the time of Paul III., there was found the body of a young lady, swimming
in a kind of bath of precious oil, or liquor, fresh and entire as if she
had been living, neither her face discolored, nor her hair disordered; at
her feet burnt a lamp, which suddenly expired at the opening of the
vault; having flamed, as was computed, now 1,500 years, by the conjecture
that she was Tulliola, the daughter of Cicero, whose body was thus found,
and as the inscription testified. We dined this day at Terracina,
heretofore the famous Anxur, which stands upon a very eminent promontory,
the Circean by name. While meat was preparing, I went up into the town,
and viewed the fair remainders of Jupiter's Temple, now converted into a
church, adorned with most stately columns; its architecture has been
excellent, as may be deduced from the goodly cornices, moldings, and huge
white marbles of which it is built. Before the portico stands a pillar
thus inscribed:

    "_Inclyta Gothorum Regis monumenta vetusta
          Anxuri hoc Oculos exposuere loco;_"

for, it seems, Theodoric drained their marches.

On another more ancient:

    "_Imp. Cæsar Divi Nervæ Filius Nerva Trojanus Aug. Germanicus
    Dacicus. Pontif. Max. Trib. Pop. xviii. Imp. vi. Cos. v. p. p.
    xviii. Silices suâ pecuniâ stravit._"

Meaning doubtless, some part of the Via Appia. Then:

    "_Tit. Upio. Aug. optato Pontano Procuratori et Præfect.
    Classis.--Ti. Julius. T. Fab. optatus, II. vir._"

[Sidenote: FONDI]

Here is likewise a Columna Milliaria, with something engraven on it, but
I could not stay to consider it. Coming down again, I went toward the
sea-side to contemplate that stupendous strange rock and promontory,
cleft by hand, I suppose, for the better passage. Within this is the
Circean Cave, which I went into a good way; it makes a dreadful noise, by
reason of the roaring and impetuous waves continually assaulting the
beach, and that in an unusual manner. At the top, at an excessive height,
stands an old and very great castle. We arrived this night at Fondi, a
most dangerous passage for robbing; and so we passed by Galba's villa,
and anon entered the kingdom of Naples, where, at the gate, this epigraph
saluted us: "_Hospes, hìc sunt fines Regni Neopolitani; si amicus
advenis, pacatè omnia invenies, et malis moribus pulsis, bonas leges_."
The Via Appia is here a noble prospect; having before considered how it
was carried through vast mountains of rocks for many miles, by most
stupendous labor: here it is infinitely pleasant, beset with sepulchres
and antiquities, full of sweet shrubs in the environing hedges. At Fondi,
we had oranges and citrons for nothing, the trees growing in every
corner, charged with fruit.

29th January, 1645. We descried Mount Cæcubus, famous for the generous
wine it heretofore produced, and so rode onward the Appian Way, beset
with myrtles, lentiscuses, bays, pomegranates, and whole groves of orange
trees, and most delicious shrubs, till we came to Formiana [Formiæ],
where they showed us Cicero's tomb, standing in an olive grove, now a
rude heap of stones without form or beauty; for here that incomparable
orator was murdered. I shall never forget how exceedingly I was
delighted with the sweetness of this passage, the sepulchre mixed among
all sorts of verdure; besides being now come within sight of the noble
city, Cajeta [Gaieta], which gives a surprising prospect along the
Tyrrhene Sea, in manner of a theater: and here we beheld that strangely
cleft rock, a frightful spectacle, which they say happened upon the
passion of our Blessed Savior; but the haste of our procaccio did not
suffer us to dwell so long on these objects and the many antiquities of
this town as we desired.

At Formi, we saw Cicero's grot; dining at Mola, and passing Sinuessa,
Garigliano (once the city Mintern), and beheld the ruins of that vast
amphitheater and aqueduct yet standing; the river Liris, which bounded
the old Latium, Falernus, or Mons Massacus, celebrated for its wine, now
named Garo; and this night we lodged at a little village called St.
Agatha, in the Falernian Fields, near to Aurunca and Sessa.

The next day, having passed [the river] Vulturnus, we come by the Torre
di Francolisi, where Hannibal, in danger from Fabius Maximus, escaped by
debauching his enemies; and so at last we entered the most pleasant
plains of Campania, now called Terra di Lavoro; in very truth, I think,
the most fertile spot that ever the sun shone upon. Here we saw the
slender ruins of the once mighty Capua, contending at once both with Rome
and Carthage, for splendor and empire, now nothing but a heap of rubbish,
except showing some vestige of its former magnificence in pieces of
temples, arches, theatres, columns, ports, vaults, colosses, etc.,
confounded together by the barbarous Goths and Longobards; there is,
however, a new city, nearer to the road by two miles, fairly raised out
of these heaps. The passage from this town to Naples (which is about ten
or twelve English post miles) is as straight as a line, of great breadth,
fuller of travelers than I remember any of our greatest and most
frequented roads near London; but, what is extremely pleasing, is the
great fertility of the fields, planted with fruit trees, whose boles are
serpented with excellent vines, and they so exuberant, that it is
commonly reported one vine will load five mules with its grapes. What
adds much to the pleasure of the sight is, that the vines, climbing to
the summit of the trees, reach in festoons and fruitages from one tree to
another, planted at exact distances, forming a more delightful picture
than painting can describe. Here grow rice, canes for sugar, olives,
pomegranates, mulberries, citrons, oranges, figs, and other sorts of rare
fruits. About the middle of the way is the town Aversa, whither came
three or four coaches to meet our lady travelers, of whom we now took
leave, having been very merry by the way with them and the capitáno,
their gallant.

31st January, 1645. About noon we entered the city of Naples, alighting
at the Three Kings, where we found the most plentiful fare all the time
we were in Naples. Provisions are wonderfully cheap; we seldom sat down
to fewer than eighteen or twenty dishes of exquisite meat and fruits.

The morrow after our arrival, in the afternoon, we hired a coach to carry
us about the town. First, we went to the castle of St. Elmo, built on a
very high rock, whence we had an entire prospect of the whole city, which
lies in shape of a theatre upon the sea-brink, with all the circumjacent
islands, as far as Capreæ, famous for the debauched recesses of Tiberius.
This fort is the bridle of the whole city, and was well stored and
garrisoned with native Spaniards. The strangeness of the precipice and
rareness of the prospect of so many magnificent and stately palaces,
churches, and monasteries, with the Arsenal, the Mole, and Mount Vesuvius
in the distance, all in full command of the eye, make it one of the
richest landscapes in the world.

Hence, we descended to another strong castle, called Il Castello Nuovo,
which protects the shore; but they would by no entreaty permit us to go
in; the outward defense seems to consist but in four towers, very high,
and an exceeding deep graff, with thick walls. Opposite to this is the
tower of St. Vincent, which is also very strong.

Then we went to the very noble palace of the Viceroy, partly old, and
part of a newer work; but we did not stay long here. Toward the evening,
we took the air upon the Mole, a street on the rampart, or bank, raised
in the sea for security of their galleys in port, built as that of Genoa.
Here I observed a rich fountain in the middle of the piazza, and adorned
with divers rare statues of copper, representing the Sirens, or Deities
of the Parthenope, spouting large streams of water into an ample shell,
all of cast metal, and of great cost. This stands at the entrance of the
Mole, where we met many of the nobility both on horseback and in their
coaches to take the fresco from the sea, as the manner is, it being in
the most advantageous quarter for good air, delight and prospect. Here we
saw divers goodly horses who handsomely become their riders, the
Neapolitan gentlemen. This Mole is about 500 paces in length, and paved
with a square hewn stone. From the Mole, we ascend to a church of great
antiquity, formerly sacred to Castor and Pollux, as the Greek letters
carved on the architrave and the busts of their two statues testify. It
is now converted into a stately oratory by the Theatines.

The Cathedral is a most magnificent pile, and except St. Peter's in Rome,
Naples exceeds all cities for stately churches and monasteries. We were
told that this day the blood of St. Januarius and his head should be
exposed, and so we found it, but obtained not to see the miracle of the
boiling of this blood. The next we went to see was St. Peter's, richly
adorned, the chapel especially, where that Apostle said mass, as is
testified on the wall.

After dinner we went to St. Dominic, where they showed us the crucifix
that is reported to have said these words to St. Thomas, "_Benè de me
scripsisti, Thoma_." Hence, to the Padri Olivetani, famous for the
monument of the learned Alexander-ab-Alexandro.

We proceeded, the next day, to visit the church of Santa Maria Maggiore,
where we spent much time in surveying the chapel of Joh. Jov. Pontanus,
and in it the several and excellent sentences and epitaphs on himself,
wife, children, and friends, full of rare wit, and worthy of recording,
as we find them in several writers. In the same chapel is shown an arm of
Titus Livius, with this epigraph. "_Titi Livij brachium quod Anton.
Panormita a Patavinis impetravit, Jo. Jovianus Pontanus multos post annos
hôc in loco ponendum curavit._"

Climbing a steep hill, we came to the monastery and Church of the
Carthusians, from whence is a most goodly prospect toward the sea and
city, the one full of galleys and ships, the other of stately palaces,
churches, monasteries, castles, gardens, delicious fields and meadows,
Mount Vesuvius smoking, the promontory of Minerva and Misenum, Capreæ,
Prochyta, Ischia, Pausilipum, Puteoli, and the rest, doubtless one of the
most divertissant and considerable vistas in the world. The church is
most elegantly built; the very pavements of the common cloister being all
laid with variously polished marbles, richly figured. They showed us a
massy cross of silver, much celebrated for the workmanship and carving,
and said to have been fourteen years in perfecting. The choir also is of
rare art; but above all to be admired, is the yet unfinished church of
the Jesuits, certainly, if accomplished, not to be equalled in Europe.
Hence, we passed by the Palazzo Caraffii, full of ancient and very noble
statues: also the palace of the Orsini. The next day, we did little but
visit some friends, English merchants, resident for their negotiation;
only this morning at the Viceroy's Cavalerizza I saw the noblest horses
that I had ever beheld, one of his sons riding the menage with that
address and dexterity as I had never seen anything approach it.

4th February, 1645. We were invited to the collection of exotic rarities
in the Museum of Ferdinando Imperati, a Neapolitan nobleman, and one of
the most observable palaces in the city, the repository of incomparable
rarities. Among the natural herbals most remarkable was the Byssus marina
and Pinna marina; the male and female chameleon; an Onocrotatus; an
extraordinary great crocodile; some of the Orcades Anates, held here for
a great rarity; likewise a salamander; the male and female Manucordiata,
the male having a hollow in the back, in which it is reported the female
both lays and hatches her eggs; the mandragoras, of both sexes; Papyrus,
made of several reeds, and some of silk; tables of the rinds of trees,
written with Japonic characters; another of the branches of palm; many
Indian fruits; a crystal that had a quantity of uncongealed water within
its cavity; a petrified fisher's net; divers sorts of tarantulas, being a
monstrous spider, with lark-like claws, and somewhat bigger.

5th February, 1645. This day we beheld the Vice-king's procession, which
was very splendid for the relics, banners, and music that accompanied
the Blessed Sacrament. The ceremony took up most of the morning.

6th February, 1645. We went by coach to take the air, and see the
diversions, or rather madness of the Carnival; the courtesans (who swarm
in this city to the number, as we are told, of 30,000, registered and
paying a tax to the State) flinging eggs of sweet water into our coach,
as we passed by the houses and windows. Indeed, the town is so pestered
with these cattle, that there needs no small mortification to preserve
from their enchantment, while they display all their natural and
artificial beauty, play, sing, feign compliment, and by a thousand
studied devices seek to inveigle foolish young men.

[Sidenote: VESUVIUS]

7th February, 1645. The next day, being Saturday, we went four miles out
of town on mules, to see that famous volcano, Mount Vesuvius. Here we
pass a fair fountain, called Labulla, which continually boils, supposed
to proceed from Vesuvius, and thence over a river and bridge, where on a
large upright stone, is engraven a notable inscription relative to the
memorable eruption in 1630.

Approaching the hill, as we were able with our mules, we alighted,
crawling up the rest of the proclivity with great difficulty, now with
our feet, now with our hands, not without many untoward slips which did
much bruise us on the various colored cinders, with which the whole
mountain is covered, some like pitch, others full of perfect brimstone,
others metallic, interspersed with innumerable pumices (of all which I
made a collection), we at the last gained the summit of an extensive
altitude. Turning our faces toward Naples, it presents one of the
goodliest prospects in the world; all the Baiæ, Cuma, Elysian Fields,
Capreæ, Ischia, Prochyta, Misenus, Puteoli, that goodly city, with a
great portion of the Tyrrhene Sea, offering themselves to your view at
once, and at so agreeable a distance, as nothing can be more delightful.
The mountain consists of a double top, the one pointed very sharp, and
commonly appearing above any clouds, the other blunt. Here, as we
approached, we met many large gaping clefts and chasms, out of which
issued such sulphurous blasts and smoke, that we dared not stand long
near them. Having gained the very summit, I laid myself down to look
over into that most frightful and terrible vorago, a stupendous pit of
near three miles in circuit, and half a mile in depth, by a perpendicular
hollow cliff (like that from the highest part of Dover Castle), with now
and then a craggy prominency jetting out. The area at the bottom is
plane, like an even floor, which seems to be made by the wind circling
the ashes by its eddy blasts. In the middle and centre is a hill, shaped
like a great brown loaf, appearing to consist of sulphurous matter,
continually vomiting a foggy exhalation, and ejecting huge stones with an
impetuous noise and roaring, like the report of many muskets discharging.
This horrid barathrum engaged our attention for some hours, both for the
strangeness of the spectacle, and the mention which the old histories
make of it, as one of the most stupendous curiosities in nature, and
which made the learned and inquisitive Pliny adventure his life to detect
the causes, and to lose it in too desperate an approach. It is likewise
famous for the stratagem of the rebel, Spartacus, who did so much
mischief to the State lurking among and protected by, these horrid
caverns, when it was more accessible and less dangerous than it is now;
but especially notorious it is for the last conflagration, when, in
_anno_ 1630, it burst out beyond what it had ever done in the memory of
history; throwing out huge stones and fiery pumices in such quantity, as
not only environed the whole mountain, but totally buried and overwhelmed
divers towns and their inhabitants, scattering the ashes more than a
hundred miles, and utterly devastating all those vineyards, where
formerly grew the most incomparable Greco; when, bursting through the
bowels of the earth, it absorbed the very sea, and, with its whirling
waters, drew in divers galleys and other vessels to their destruction, as
is faithfully recorded. We descended with more ease than we climbed up,
through a deep valley of pure ashes, which at the late eruption was a
flowing river of melted and burning brimstone, and so came to our mules
at the foot of the mountain.

On Sunday, we with our guide visited the so much celebrated Baia, and
natural rarities of the places adjacent. Here we entered the mountain
Pausilypus, at the left hand of which they showed us Virgil's sepulchre
erected on a steep rock, in form of a small rotunda or cupolated column,
but almost overgrown with bushes and wild bay trees. At the entrance is
this inscription:

                _Stanisi Cencovius.
                        1589
    Qui cineres? Tumuli hæc vestigia, conditur olim
        Ille hôc qui cecinit Pascua, Rura Duces.
                Can Ree MDLIII._[26]

        [Footnote 26: Such is the inscription, as copied by Evelyn;
        but as its sense is not very clear, and the Diary contains
        instances of incorrectness in transcribing, it may be desirable
        to subjoin the distich said (by Keysler in his "Travels," ii. 433)
        to be the only one in the whole mausoleum:

            "_Quæ cineris tumulo hæc vestigia? conditur olim
            Ille hoc qui cecinit pascua, rura, duces._"]

After we were advanced into this noble and altogether wonderful crypt,
consisting of a passage spacious enough for two coaches to go abreast,
cut through a rocky mountain near three quarters of a mile (by the
ancient Cimmerii as reported, but as others say by L. Cocceius, who
employed a hundred thousand men on it), we came to the midway, where
there is a well bored through the diameter of this vast mountain, which
admits the light into a pretty chapel, hewn out of the natural rock,
wherein hang divers lamps, perpetually burning. The way is paved under
foot; but it does not hinder the dust, which rises so excessively in this
much-frequented passage, that we were forced at midday to use a torch. At
length, we were delivered from the bowels of the earth into one of the
most delicious plains in the world: the oranges, lemons, pomegranates,
and other fruits, blushing yet on the perpetually green trees; for the
summer is here eternal, caused by the natural and adventitious heat of
the earth, warmed through the subterranean fires, as was shown us by our
guide, who alighted, and, cutting up a turf with his knife, and
delivering it to me, it was so hot, I was hardly able to hold it in my
hands. This mountain is exceedingly fruitful in vines, and exotics grow
readily.

[Sidenote: LAGO D'AGNANO]

We now came to a lake of about two miles in circumference, environed with
hills; the water of it is fresh and sweet on the surface, but salt at
bottom; some mineral salt conjectured to be the cause, and it is reported
of that profunditude in the middle that it is bottomless. The people
call it Lago d'Agnano, from the multitude of serpents which, involved
together about the spring, fall down from the cliffy hills into it. It
has no fish, nor will any live in it. We tried the old experiment on a
dog in the Grotto del Cane, or Charon's Cave; it is not above three or
four paces deep, and about the height of a man, nor very broad. Whatever
having life enters it, presently expires. Of this we made trial with two
dogs, one of which we bound to a short pole to guide him the more
directly into the further part of the den, where he was no sooner
entered, but--without the least noise, or so much as a struggle, except
that he panted for breath, lolling out his tongue, his eyes being
fixed:--we drew him out dead to all appearance; but immediately plunging
him into the adjoining lake, within less than half an hour he recovered,
and swimming to shore, ran away from us. We tried the same on another
dog, without the application of the water, and left him quite dead. The
experiment has been made on men, as on that poor creature whom Peter of
Toledo caused to go in; likewise on some Turkish slaves; two soldiers,
and other foolhardy persons, who all perished, and could never be
recovered by the water of the lake, as are dogs; for which many learned
reasons have been offered, as Simon Majolus in his book of the
Canicular-days has mentioned, colloq. 15. And certainly the most likely
is, the effect of those hot and dry vapors which ascend out of the earth,
and are condensed by the ambient cold, as appears by their converting
into crystalline drops on the top, while at the bottom it is so
excessively hot, that a torch being extinguished near it, and lifted a
little distance, was suddenly re-lighted.

Near to this cave are the natural stoves of St. Germain, of the nature of
sudatories, in certain chambers partitioned with stone for the sick to
sweat in, the vapors here being exceedingly hot, and of admirable success
in the gout, and other cold distempers of the nerves. Hence, we climed up
a hill, the very highway in several places even smoking with heat like a
furnace. The mountains were by the Greeks called Leucogæi, and the fields
Phlegræn. Hercules here vanquished the Giants, assisted with lightning.
We now came to the Court of Vulcan, consisting of a valley near a quarter
of a mile in breadth, the margin environed with steep cliffs, out of
whose sides and foot break forth fire and smoke in abundance, making a
noise like a tempest of water, and sometimes discharging in loud reports,
like so many guns. The heat of this place is wonderful, the earth itself
being almost unsufferable, and which the subterranean fires have made so
hollow, by having wasted the matter for so many years, that it sounds
like a drum to those who walk upon it; and the water thus struggling with
those fires bubbles and spouts aloft into the air. The mouths of these
spiracles are bestrewed with variously colored cinders, which rise with
the vapor, as do many colored stones, according to the quality of the
combustible matter, insomuch as it is no little adventure to approach
them. They are, however, daily frequented both by sick and well; the
former receiving the fumes, have been recovered of diseases esteemed
incurable. Here we found a great deal of sulphur made, which they refine
in certain houses near the place, casting it into canes, to a very great
value. Near this we were showed a hill of alum, where is one of the best
mineries, yielding a considerable revenue. Some flowers of brass are
found here; but I could not but smile at those who persuade themselves
that here are the gates of purgatory (for which it may be they have
erected, very near it, a convent, and named it St. Januarius), reporting
to have often heard screeches and horrible lamentations proceeding from
these caverns and volcanoes; with other legends of birds that are never
seen, save on Sundays, which cast themselves into the lake at night,
appearing no more all the week after.

We now approached the ruins of a very stately temple, or theater, of 172
feet in length, and about 80 in breadth, thrown down by an earthquake,
not long since; it was consecrated to Vulcan, and under the ground are
many strange meanders; from which it is named the LABYRINTH; this place
is so haunted with bats, that their perpetual fluttering endangered the
putting out our links.

[Sidenote: POZZOLO]

Hence, we passed again those boiling and smoking hills, till we came to
Pozzolo, formerly the famous Puteoli, the landing-place of St. Paul, when
he came into Italy, after the tempest described in the Acts of the
Apostles. Here we made a good dinner, and bought divers medals,
antiquities, and other curiosities, of the country people, who daily
find such things among the very old ruins of those places. This town was
formerly a Greek colony, built by the Samians, a seasonable commodious
port, and full of observable antiquities. We saw the ruins of Neptune's
Temple, to whom this place was sacred, and near it the stately palace and
gardens of Peter de Toledo, formerly mentioned. Afterward, we visited
that admirably built Temple of Augustus, seeming to have been hewn out of
an entire rock, though indeed consisting of several square stones. The
inscription remains thus: "_L. Calphurnius L. F. Templum Augusto cum
ornamentis D. D._;" and under it, "_L. Coccejus L. C. Postumi L. Auctus
Architectus_." It is now converted into a church, in which they showed us
huge bones, which they affirm to have been of some giant.

We went to see the ruins of the old haven, so compact with that
bituminous sand in which the materials are laid, as the like is hardly to
be found, though all this has not been sufficient to protect it from the
fatal concussions of several earthquakes (frequent here) which have
almost demolished it, thirteen vast piles of marble only remaining; a
stupendous work in the bosom of Neptune! To this joins the bridge of
Caligula, by which (having now embarked ourselves) we sailed to the
pleasant Baia, almost four miles in length, all which way that proud
Emperor would pass in triumph. Here we rowed along toward a villa of the
orator Cicero's, where we were shown the ruins of his Academy; and, at
the foot of a rock, his Baths, the waters reciprocating their tides with
the neighboring sea. Hard at hand, rises Mount Gaurus, being, as I
conceived, nothing save a heap of pumices, which here float in abundance
on the sea, exhausted of all inflammable matter by the fire, which
renders them light and porous, so as the beds of nitre, which lie deep
under them, having taken fire, do easily eject them. They dig much for
fancied treasure said to be concealed about this place. From hence, we
coasted near the ruins of Portus Julius, where we might see divers
stately palaces that had been swallowed up by the sea after earthquakes.
Coming to shore, we pass by the Lucrine Lake, so famous heretofore for
its delicious oysters, now producing few or none, being divided from the
sea by a bank of incredible labor, the supposed work of Hercules; it is
now half choked up with rubbish, and by part of the new mountain, which
rose partly out of it, and partly out of the sea, and that in the space
of one night and a day, to a very great altitude, on the 29th September,
1538, after many terrible earthquakes, which ruined divers places
thereabout, when at midnight the sea retiring near 200 paces, and yawning
on the sudden, it continued to vomit forth flames and fiery stones in
such quantity, as produced this whole mountain by their fall, making the
inhabitants of Pozzolo to leave their habitations, supposing the end of
the world had been come.

From the left part of this, we walked to the Lake Avernus of a round
form, and totally environed with mountains. This lake was feigned by the
poet for the gates of hell, by which Æneas made his descent, and where he
sacrificed to Pluto and the Manes. The waters are of a remarkably black
color; but I tasted of them without danger; hence, they feign that the
river Styx has its source. At one side, stand the handsome ruins of a
Temple dedicated to Apollo, or rather Pluto, but it is controverted.
Opposite to this, having new lighted our torches, we enter a vast cave,
in which having gone about two hundred paces, we pass a narrow entry
which leads us into a room of about ten paces long, proportionably broad
and high; the side walls and roof retain still the golden mosaic, though
now exceedingly decayed by time. Here is a short cell or rather niche,
cut out of the solid rock, somewhat resembling a couch, in which they
report that the Sibylla lay, and uttered her Oracles; but it is supposed
by most to have been a bath only. This subterranean grot leads quite
through to Cuma, but is in some places obstructed by the earth which has
sunk in, so as we were constrained back again, and to creep on our
bellies, before we came to the light. It is reported Nero had once
resolved to cut a channel for two great galleys that should have extended
to Ostia, 150 miles distant. The people now call it Licola.

From hence, we ascended to that most ancient city of Italy, the renowned
Cuma, built by the Grecians. It stands on a very eminent promontory, but
is now a heap of ruins. A little below, stands the Arco Felice,
heretofore part of Apollo's Temple, with the foundations of divers goodly
buildings; among whose heaps are frequently found statues and other
antiquities, by such as dig for them. Near this is the Lake Acherutia,
and Acheron. Returning to the shore, we came to the Bagni de Tritoli and
Diana, which are only long narrow passages cut through the main rock,
where the vapors ascend so hot, that entering with the body erect you
will even faint with excessive perspiration; but, stooping lower, as
sudden a cold surprises. These sudatories are much in request for many
infirmities. Now we entered the haven of the Bahiæ, where once stood that
famous town, so-called from the companion of Ulysses here buried; not
without great reason celebrated for one of the most delicious places that
the sun shines on, according to that of Horace:

    "_Nullus in Orbe locus Baiis prælucet amoenis._"

Though, as to the stately fabrics, there now remain little save the
ruins, whereof the most entire is that of Diana's Temple, and another of
Venus. Here were those famous poles of lampreys that would come to hand
when called by name, as Martial tells us. On the summit of the rock
stands a strong castle garrisoned to protect the shore from Turkish
pirates. It was once the retiring place of Julius Cæsar.

Passing by the shore again, we entered Bauli, observable from the
monstrous murder of Nero committed on his mother Agrippina. Her sepulchre
was yet shown us in the rock, which we entered, being covered with sundry
heads and figures of beasts. We saw there the roots of a tree turned into
stone, and are continually dropping.

[Sidenote: MISENUS]

Thus having viewed the foundations of the old Cimmeria, the palaces of
Marius, Pompey, Nero, Hortensius, and other villas and antiquities, we
proceeded toward the promontory of Misenus, renowned for the sepulchre of
Æneas's Trumpeter. It was once a great city, now hardly a ruin, said to
have been built from this place to the promontory of Minerva, fifty miles
distant, now discontinued and demolished by the frequent earthquakes.
Here was the villa of Caius Marius, where Tiberius Cæsar died; and here
runs the Aqueduct, thought to be dug by Nero, a stupendous passage,
heretofore nobly arched with marble, as the ruins testify. Hence, we
walked to those receptacles of water called _Piscina Mirabilis_, being a
vault of 500 feet long, and twenty-two in breadth, the roof propped up
with four ranks of square pillars, twelve in a row; the walls are brick,
plastered over with such a composition as for strength and politure
resembles white marble. 'Tis conceived to have been built by Nero, as a
conservatory for fresh water; as were also the Centi Camerelli, into
which we were next led. All these crypta being now almost sunk into the
earth, show yet their former amplitude and magnificence.

Returning toward the Baia, we again pass the Elysian Fields, so
celebrated by the poets, nor unworthily, for their situation and verdure,
being full of myrtles and sweet shrubs, and having a most delightful
prospect toward the Tyrrhene Sea. Upon the verge of these remain the
ruins of the Mercato di Saboto, formerly a Circus; over the arches stand
divers urns, full of Roman ashes.

Having well satisfied our curiosity among these antiquities, we retired
to our felucca, which rowed us back again toward Pozzolo, at the very
place of St. Paul's landing. Keeping along the shore, they showed us a
place where the sea water and sands did exceedingly boil. Thence, to the
island Nesis, once the fabulous Nymph; and thus we leave the Baia, so
renowned for the sweet retirements of the most opulent and voluptuous
Romans. They certainly were places of uncommon amenity, as their yet
tempting site, and other circumstances of natural curiosities, easily
invite me to believe, since there is not in the world so many stupendous
rarities to be met with, as in the circle of a few miles which environ
these blissful abodes.

[Sidenote: NAPLES]

8th February, 1645. Returned to Naples, we went to see the Arsenal, well
furnished with galleys and other vessels. The city is crowded with
inhabitants, gentlemen and merchants. The government is held of the Pope
by an annual tribute of 40,000 ducats and a white jennet; but the
Spaniard trusts more to the power of those his natural subjects there;
Apulia and Calabria yielding him near four millions of crowns yearly to
maintain it. The country is divided into thirteen Provinces, twenty
Archbishops, and one hundred and seven Bishops; the estates of the
nobility, in default of the male line, reverting to the King. Besides the
Vice-Roy, there is among the Chief Magistrates a High Constable,
Admiral, Chief Justice, Great Chamberlain, and Chancellor, with a
Secretary; these being prodigiously avaricious, do wonderfully enrich
themselves out of the miserable people's labor, silks, manna, sugar, oil,
wine, rice, sulphur, and alum; for with all these riches is this
delicious country blest. The manna falls at certain seasons on the
adjoining hills in form of a thick dew. The very winter here is a summer,
ever fruitful, so that in the middle of February we had melons, cherries,
apricots, and many other sorts of fruit.

The building of the city is for the size the most magnificent of any in
Europe, the streets exceeding large, well paved, having many vaults and
conveyances under them for the sulliage; which renders them very sweet
and clean, even in the midst of winter. To it belongeth more than 3,000
churches and monasteries, and these the best built and adorned of any in
Italy. They greatly affect the Spanish gravity in their habit; delight in
good horses; the streets are full of gallants on horseback, in coaches
and sedans, from hence brought first into England by Sir Sanders Duncomb.
The women are generally well featured, but excessively libidinous. The
country people so jovial and addicted to music, that the very husbandmen
almost universally play on the guitar, singing and composing songs in
praise of their sweethearts, and will commonly go to the field with their
fiddle; they are merry, witty, and genial; all which I much attribute to
the excellent quality of the air. They have a deadly hatred to the
French, so that some of our company were flouted at for wearing red
cloaks, as the mode then was.

This I made the _non ultra_ of my travels, sufficiently sated with
rolling up and down, and resolving within myself to be no longer an
_individuum vagum_, if ever I got home again; since, from the report of
divers experienced and curious persons, I had been assured there was
little more to be seen in the rest of the civil world, after Italy,
France, Flanders, and the Low Countries, but plain and prodigious
barbarism.

[Sidenote: ROME]

Thus, about the 7th of February,[27] we set out on our return to Rome by
the same way we came, not daring to adventure by sea, as some of our
company were inclined to do, for fear of Turkish pirates hovering on that
coast; nor made we any stay save at Albano, to view the celebrated place
and sepulchre of the famous duelists who decided the ancient quarrel
between their imperious neighbors with the loss of their lives. These
brothers, the Horatii and Curiatii, lie buried near the highway, under
two ancient pyramids of stone, now somewhat decayed and overgrown with
rubbish. We took the opportunity of tasting the wine here, which is
famous.

    [Footnote 27: Evelyn's dates in this portion of his Diary appear to
    require occasionally that qualification of "about."]

Being arrived at Rome on the 13th of February, we were again invited to
Signor Angeloni's study, where with greater leisure we surveyed the
rarities, as his cabinet and medals especially, esteemed one of the best
collections of them in Europe. He also showed us two antique lamps, one
of them dedicated to Pallas, the other _Laribus Sacru'_, as appeared by
their inscriptions; some old Roman rings and keys; the Egyptian Isis,
cast in iron; sundry rare basso-relievos; good pieces of paintings,
principally of Christ of Correggio, with this painter's own face
admirably done by himself; divers of both the Bassanos; a great number of
pieces by Titian, particularly the Triumphs; an infinity of natural
rarities, dried animals, Indian habits and weapons, shells, etc.; divers
very antique statues of brass; some lamps of so fine an earth that they
resembled cornelians, for transparency and color; hinges of Corinthian
brass, and one great nail of the same metal found in the ruins of Nero's
golden house.

In the afternoon, we ferried over to Transtevere, to the palace of Gichi,
to review the works of Raphael: and, returning by St. Angelo, we saw the
castle as far as was permitted, and on the other side considered those
admirable pilasters supposed to be of the foundation of the Pons
Sublicius, over which Horatius Cocles passed; here anchor three or four
water mills, invented by Belizarius: and thence had another sight of the
Farnesi's gardens, and of the terrace where is that admirable painting of
Raphael, being a Cupid playing with a Dolphin, wrought _á fresco_,
preserved in shutters of wainscot, as well it merits, being certainly one
of the most wonderful pieces of work in the world.

14th February, 1645. I went to Santa Cecilia, a church built and endowed
by Cardinal Sfrondæti, who has erected a stately altar near the body of
this martyr, not long before found in a vesture of silk girt about, a
veil on her head, and the bloody scars of three wounds on the neck; the
body is now in a silver chest, with her statue over it, in snow-white
marble. Other Saints lie here, decorated with splendid ornaments, lamps,
and incensories of great cost. A little farther, they show us the Bath of
St. Cecilia, to which joins a Convent of Friars, where is the picture of
the Flagellation by Vanni, and the columns of the portico, taken from the
Baths of Septimius Severus.

15th February, 1645. Mr. Henshaw and I walked by the Tiber, and visited
the Stola Tybertina (now St. Bartholomew's), formerly cut in the shape of
a ship, and wharfed with marble, in which a lofty obelisk represented the
mast. In the church of St. Bartholomew is the body of the Apostle. Here
are the ruins of the Temple of Æsculapius, now converted into a stately
hospital and a pretty convent. Opposite to it, is the convent and church
of St. John Calabita, where I saw nothing remarkable, save an old broken
altar. Here was the Temple of Fortuna Virilis. Hence, we went to a
cupola, now a church, formerly dedicated to the sun. Opposite to it,
Santa Maria Schola Græca, where formerly that tongue was taught; said to
be the second church dedicated in Rome to the Blessed Virgin; bearing
also the title of a Cardinalate. Behind this stands the great altar of
Hercules, much demolished. Near this, being at the foot of Mount
Aventine, are the Pope's salt houses. Ascending the hill, we came to St.
Sabina, an ancient fabric, formerly sacred to Diana; there, in a chapel,
is an admirable picture, the work of Livia Fontana, set about with
columns of alabaster, and in the middle of the church is a stone, cast,
as they report, by the Devil at St. Dominic, while he was at mass. Hence,
we traveled toward a heap of rubbish, called the Marmorata, on the bank
of the Tiber, a magazine of stones; and near which formerly stood a
triumphal arch, in honor of Horatius vanquishing the Tuscans. The ruins
of the bridge yet appear.

We were now got to Mons Testaceus, a heap of potsherds, almost 200 feet
high, thought to have been thrown there and amassed by the subjects of
the Commonwealth bringing their tribute in earthen vessels, others (more
probably) that it was a quarter of the town where potters lived; at the
summit Rome affords a noble prospect. Before it is a spacious green,
called the Hippodrome, where Olympic games were celebrated, and the
people mustered, as in our London Artillery-Ground. Going hence, to the
old wall of the city, we much admired the pyramid, or tomb, of Caius
Cestius, of white marble, one of the most ancient entire monuments,
inserted in the wall, with this inscription:

    "_C. Cestius L. F. Pob. Epulo (an order of priests) Pr. Tr. pl.
    VII. Vir. Epulonum._"

And a little beneath:

    "_Opus absolutum ex testamento diebus CCCXXX. arbitratu. Ponti P.
    F. Cla. Melæ Heredis et Pothi L._"

At the left hand, is the Port of St. Paul, once Tergemina, out of which
the three Horatii passed to encounter the Curiatii of Albano. Hence,
bending homeward by St. Saba, by Antoninus's baths (which we entered), is
the marble sepulchre of Vespasian. The thickness of the walls and the
stately ruins show the enormous magnitude of these baths. Passing by a
corner of the Circus Maximus, we viewed the place where stood the
Septizonium, demolished by Sextus V., for fear of its falling. Going by
Mons Coelius, we beheld the devotions of St. Maria in Naviculâ, so
named from a ship carved out in white marble standing on a pedestal
before it, supposed to be the vow of one escaped from shipwreck. It has a
glorious front to the street. Adjoining to this are the Hortii Mathæi,
which only of all the places about the city I omitted visiting, though I
was told inferior to no garden in Rome for statues, ancient monuments,
aviaries, fountains, groves, and especially a noble obelisk, and
maintained in beauty at an expense of 6,000 crowns yearly, which, if not
expended to keep up its beauty, forfeits the possession of a greater
revenue to another family: so curious are they in their villas and places
of pleasure, even to excess.

The next day, we went to the once famous Circus Caracalla, in the midst
of which there now lay prostrate one of the most stately and ancient
obelisks, full of Egyptian hieroglyphics. It was broken into four pieces,
when overthrown by the Barbarians, and would have been purchased and
transported into England by the magnificent Thomas Earl of Arundel,
could it have been well removed to the sea. This is since set together
and placed on the stupendous artificial rock made by Innocent X., and
serving for a fountain in Piazza Navona, the work of Bernini, the Pope's
architect. Near this is the sepulchre of Metellus, of massy stone, pretty
entire, now called Capo di Bovo. Hence, to a small oratory, named
"_Domine, quo vadis_"; where the tradition is, that our Blessed Savior
met St. Peter as he fled, and turned him back again.

St. Sebastian's was the next, a mean structure (the _facciáta_ excepted),
but is venerable, especially for the relics and grots, in which lie the
ashes of many holy men. Here is kept the pontifical chair sprinkled with
the blood of Pope Stephen, to which great devotion is paid; also a well
full of martyrs' bones, and the sepulchre of St. Sebastian, with one of
the arrows (used in shooting him). These are preserved by the Fulgentine
Monks, who have here their monastery, and who led us down into a grotto
which they affirmed went divers furlongs under ground; the sides, or
walls which we passed were filled with bones and dead bodies, laid (as it
were) on shelves, whereof some were shut up with broad stones and now and
then a cross, or a palm, cut in them. At the end of some of these
subterranean passages, were square rooms with altars in them, said to
have been the receptacles of primitive Christians, in the times of
persecution, nor seems it improbable.

17th February, 1645. I was invited, after dinner, to the Academy of the
Humorists, kept in a spacious hall belonging to Signor Mancini, where the
wits of the town meet on certain days to recite poems, and debate on
several subjects. The first that speaks is called the Lord, and stands in
an eminent place, and then the rest of the Virtuosi recite in order. By
these ingenious exercises, besides the learned discourses, is the purity
of the Italian tongue daily improved. The room is hung round with
devices, or emblems, with mottoes under them. There are several other
Academies of this nature, bearing like fantastical titles. In this of the
Humorists is the picture of Guarini, the famous author of the Pastor
Fido, once of this society. The chief part of the day we spent in hearing
the academic exercises.

18th February, 1645. We walked to St. Nicholas in Carcere; it has a fair
front, and within are parts of the bodies of St. Mark and Marcellino; on
the Tribuna is a painting of Gentileschi, and the altar of Caval;
Baglioni, with some other rare paintings. Coming round from hence we
passed by the Circus Flaminius, formerly very large, now totally in
ruins. In the afternoon, we visited the English Jesuits, with whose
Superior, P. Stafford, I was well acquainted; who received us
courteously. They call their church and college St. Thomasso de gli
Inglesi, and is a seminary. Among other trifles, they show the relics of
Becket, their reputed martyr. Of paintings there is one of Durante, and
many representing the sufferings of several of their society executed in
England, especially F. Campion.

In the Hospital of the Pelerini della S. Trinita, I had seen the feet of
many pilgrims washed by Princes, Cardinals, and noble Romans, and served
at table, as the ladies and noble women did to other poor creatures in
another room. It was told us that no less than 444,000 men had been thus
treated in the Jubilee of 1600, and 25,500 women, as appears by the
register, which brings store of money.

Returning homeward, I saw the palace of Cardinal Spada, where is a most
magnificent hall painted by Daniel de Volterra and Giulio Piacentino, who
made the fret in the little Court; but the rare perspectives are of
Bolognesi. Near this is the Mont Pieta, instituted as a bank for the
poor, who, if the sum be not great, may have money upon pawns. To this
joins St. Martino, to which belongs a Schola, or Corporation, that do
many works of charity. Hence we came through Campo di Fiori, or
herb-market, in the midst of which is a fountain casting out water of a
dolphin, in copper; and in this piazza is common execution done.

19th February, 1645. I went, this afternoon, to visit my Lord John
Somerset, brother to the Marquis of Worcester, who had his apartment in
Palazzo della Cancellaria, belonging to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, as
Vice-chancellor of the Church of Rome, and Protector of the English. The
building is of the famous architect, Bramante, of incrusted marble, with
four ranks of noble lights; the principal entrance is of Fontana's
design, and all marble; the portico within sustained by massy columns;
on the second peristyle above, the chambers are rarely painted by
Salviati and Vasari; and so ample is this palace, that six princes with
their families have been received in it at one time, without incommoding
each other.

20th February, 1645. I went, as was my usual custom, and spent an
afternoon in Piazza Navona, as well as to see what antiquities I could
purchase among the people who hold market there for medals, pictures, and
such curiosities, as to hear the mountebanks prate and distribute their
medicines. This was formerly the Circus, or Agonales, dedicated to sports
and pastimes, and is now the greatest market of the city, having three
most noble fountains, and the stately palaces of the Pamfilii, St.
Giacomo de Spagnoli belonging to that nation, to which add two convents
for friars and nuns, all Spanish. In this Church was erected a most
stately catafalco, or capellar ardente, for the death of the Queen of
Spain; the church was hung with black, and here I heard a Spanish sermon,
or funeral oration, and observed the statues, devices, and impresses hung
about the walls, the church and pyramid stuck with thousands of lights
and tapers, which made a glorious show. The statue of St. James is by
Sansovino; there are also some good pictures of Caracci. The _facciáta_,
too, is fair. Returning home, I passed by the stumps of old Pasquin, at
the corner of a street, called Strada Pontificia; here they still paste
up their drolling lampoons and scurrilous papers. This had formerly been
one of the best statues for workmanship and art in all the city, as the
remaining bust does still show.

21st February, 1645. I walked in the morning up the hill toward the
Capuchins, where was then Cardinal Unufrio (brother to the late Pope
Urban VIII.) of the same order. He built them a pretty church, full of
rare pictures, and there lies the body of St. Felix, that they say still
does miracles. The piece at the great altar is by Lanfranc. It is a lofty
edifice, with a beautiful avenue of trees, and in a good air. After
dinner, passing along the Strada del Corso, I observed the column of
Antoninus, passing under Arco Portugallo, which is but a relic,
heretofore erected in honor of Domitian, called now Portugallo, from a
Cardinal living near it. A little further on the right hand stands the
column in a small piazza, heretofore set up in honor of M. Aurelius
Antoninus, comprehending in a basso-relievo of white marble his hostile
acts against the Parthians, Armenians, Germans, etc; but it is now
somewhat decayed. On the summit has been placed the image of St. Paul, of
gilded copper. The pillar is said to be 161 feet high, ascended by 207
steps, receiving light by fifty-six apertures, without defacing the
sculpture.

At a little distance, are the relics of the Emperor's palace, the heads
of whose pillars show them to have been Corinthian.

Turning a little down, we came to another piazza, in which stands a
sumptuous vase of porphyry, and a fair fountain; but the grace of this
market, and indeed the admiration of the whole world, is the Pantheon,
now called S. Maria della Rotonda, formerly sacred to all the Gods, and
still remaining the most entire antiquity of the city. It was built by
Marcus Agrippa, as testifies the architrave of the portico, sustained by
thirteen pillars of Theban marble, six feet thick, and fifty-three in
height, of one entire stone. In this porch is an old inscription.

Entering the church, we admire the fabric, wholly covered with one
cupola, seemingly suspended in the air, and receiving light by a hole in
the middle only. The structure is near as high as broad, viz, 144 feet,
not counting the thickness of the walls, which is twenty-two more to the
top, all of white marble; and, till Urban VIII. converted part of the
metal into ordnance of war against the Duke of Parma, and part to make
the high altar in St. Peter's, it was all over covered with Corinthian
brass, ascending by forty degrees within the roof, or convex, of the
cupola, richly carved in octagons in the stone. There are niches in the
walls, in which stood heretofore the statues of Jupiter and the other
Gods and Goddesses; for here was that Venus which had hung in her ear the
other Union[28] that Cleopatra was about to dissolve and drink up, as
she had done its fellow. There are several of these niches, one above
another for the celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean deities; but the
place is now converted into a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and
all the Saints. The pavement is excellent, and the vast folding-gates, of
Corinthian brass. In a word, it is of all the Roman antiquities the most
worthy of notice. There lie interred in this Temple the famous Raphael di
Urbino, Perino del Vaga, F. Zuccharo, and other painters.

    [Footnote 28:

        And in the cup an UNION shall he throw,
        Richer than that which four successive kings
        In Denmark's crown have worn.
        --Shakespeare, "Hamlet," Act v. Sc. 2.

    Theobald says, an UNION is the finest sort of pearl, and has its
    place in all crowns and coronets. The Latin word for a single large
    pearl, it is hardly necessary to add, is _unio_.]

Returning home, we pass by Cardinal Cajetan's Palace, a noble piece of
architecture of Vincenzo Ammanatti, which is the grace of the whole
Corso.

22d February, 1645. I went to Trinitá del Monte, a monastery of French, a
noble church built by Louis XI. and Charles VIII., the chapels well
painted, especially that by Zaccara da Volterra, and the cloister with
the miracles of their St. Francis de Paulo, and the heads of the French
Kings. In the _pergolo_ above, the walls are wrought with excellent
perspective, especially the St. John; there are the Babylonish dials,
invented by Kircher, the Jesuit. This convent, so eminently situated on
Mons Pincius, has the entire prospect of Campus Martius, and has a fair
garden which joins to the Palazzo di Medici.

23d February, 1645. I went to hear a sermon at St. Giacomo degli
Incurabili, a fair church built by F. da Volterra, of good architecture,
and so is the hospital, where only desperate patients are brought. I
passed the evening at St. Maria del Popolo, heretofore Nero's sepulchre,
where his ashes lay many years in a marble chest. To this church joins
the monastery of St. Augustine, which has pretty gardens on Mons Pincius,
and in the church is the miraculous shrine of the Madonna which Pope Paul
III. brought barefooted to the place, supplicating for a victory over the
Turks in 1464. In a chapel of the Ghisi, are some rare paintings of
Raphael, and noble sculptures. Those two in the choir are by Sansovino,
and in the Chapel de Cerasii, a piece of Caravaggio. Here lie buried many
great scholars and artists, of which I took notice of this inscription:

    "_Hospes, disce novum mortis genus; improba felis,
      Dum trahitur, digitum mordet, et intereo._"

Opposite to the _facciátæ_ of the church is a superb obelisk full of
hieroglyphics, the same that Sennesertus, King of Egypt, dedicated to the
Sun; brought to Rome by Augustus, erected in the Circus Maximus, and
since placed here by Pope Sextus V. It is eighty-eight feet high, of one
entire stone, and placed with great art and engines by the famous
Domenico Fontana.

Hence, turning on the right out of the Porto del Popolo, we came to
Justinian's gardens, near the Muro Torto, so prominently built as
threatening every moment to fall, yet standing so for these thousand
years. Under this is the burying place for the common prostitutes, where
they are put into the ground, _sans ceremonie_.

24th February, 1645. We walked to St. Roche's and Martine's, near the
brink of the Tiber, a large hospital for both sexes. Hence, to the
Mausoleum Augusti, between the Tiber and the Via Flaminia, now much
ruined, which had formerly contended for its sumptuous architecture. It
was intended as a cemetery for the Roman Emperors, had twelve ports, and
was covered with a cupola of white marble, environed with stately trees
and innumerable statues, all of it now converted into a garden. We passed
the afternoon at the Sapienza, a very stately building full of good
marbles, especially the portico, of admirable architecture. These are
properly the University Schools, where lectures are read on Law,
Medicine, and Anatomy, and students perform their exercises.

Hence, we walked to the church of St. Andrea della Valle, near the former
Theater of Pompey, and the famous Piccolomini, but given to this church
and the Order, who are Theatins. The Barberini have in this place a
chapel, of curious incrusted marbles of several sorts, and rare
paintings. Under it is a place where St. Sebastian is said to have been
beaten with rods before he was shot with darts. The cupola is painted by
Lanfranc, an inestimable work, and the whole fabric and monastery
adjoining are admirable.

25th February, 1645. I was invited by a Dominican Friar, whom we usually
heard preach to a number of Jews, to be godfather to a converted Turk and
Jew. The ceremony was performed in the Church of Santa Maria sopra la
Minerva, near the Capitol. They were clad in white; then exorcised at
their entering the church with abundance of ceremonies, and, when led
into the choir, were baptized by a Bishop, _in pontificalibus_. The Turk
lived afterward in Rome, sold hot waters and would bring us presents when
he met us, kneeling and kissing the hems of our cloaks; but the Jew was
believed to be a counterfeit. This church, situated on a spacious rising,
was formerly consecrated to Minerva. It was well built and richly
adorned, and the body of St. Catherine di Sienna lies buried here. The
paintings of the chapel are by Marcello Venuti; the Madonna over the
altar is by Giovanni di Fiesole, called the Angelic Painter, who was of
the Order of these Monks. There are many charities dealt publicly here,
especially at the procession on the Annunciation, where I saw his
Holiness, with all the Cardinals, Prelates, etc., _in pontificalibus_;
dowries being given to 300 poor girls all clad in white. The Pope had his
tiara on his head, and was carried on men's shoulders in an open
armchair, blessing the people as he passed. The statue of Christ, at the
Columna, is esteemed one of the masterpieces of M. Angelo: innumerable
are the paintings by the best artists, and the organ is accounted one of
the sweetest in Rome. Cardinal Bembo is interred here. We returned by St.
Mark's, a stately church, with an excellent pavement, and a fine piece by
Perugino, of the Two Martyrs. Adjoining to this is a noble palace built
by the famous Bramante.

26th February, 1645. Ascending the hill, we came to the Forum Trajanum,
where his column stands yet entire, wrought with admirable basso-relievo
recording the Dacian war, the figures at the upper part appearing of the
same proportion with those below. It is ascended by 192 steps,
enlightened with 44 apertures, or windows, artificially disposed; in
height from the pedestal 140 feet.

It had once the ashes of Trajan and his statue, where now stands St.
Peter's of gilt brass, erected by Pope Sextus V. The sculpture of this
stupendous pillar is thought to be the work of Apollodorus; but what is
very observable is, the descent to the plinth of the pedestal, showing
how this ancient city lies now buried in her ruins; this monument being
at first set up on a rising ground. After dinner, we took the air in
Cardinal Bentivoglio's delicious gardens, now but newly deceased. He had
a fair palace built by several good masters on part of the ruins of
Constantine's Baths; well adorned with columns and paintings, especially
those of Guido Reni.

27th February, 1645. In the morning Mr. Henshaw and myself walked to the
Trophies of Marius, erected in honor of his victory over the Cimbrians,
but these now taken out of their niches are placed on the balusters of
the Capitol, so that their ancient station is now a ruin. Keeping on our
way, we came to St. Croce of Jerusalem, built by Constantine over the
demolition of the Temple of Venus and Cupid, which he threw down; and it
was here, they report, he deposited the wood of the true Cross, found by
his mother, Helena; in honor whereof this church was built, and in memory
of his victory over Maxentius when that holy sign appeared to him. The
edifice without is Gothic, but very glorious within, especially the roof,
and one tribuna (gallery) well painted. Here is a chapel dedicated to St.
Helena, the floor whereof is of earth brought from Jerusalem; the walls
are of fair mosaic, in which they suffer no women to enter, save once a
year. Under the high altar of the Church is buried St. Anastasius, in
Lydian marble, and Benedict VII.; and they show a number of relics,
exposed at our request; with a phial of our blessed Savior's blood; two
thorns of his crown; three chips of the real cross; one of the nails,
wanting a point; St. Thomas's doubting finger; and a fragment of the
title (put on the cross), being part of a thin board; some of Judas's
pieces of silver; and many more, if one had faith to believe it. To this
venerable church joins a Monastery, the gardens taking up the space of an
ancient amphitheatre.

Hence, we passed beyond the walls out at the Port of St. Laurence, to
that Saint's church, and where his ashes are enshrined. This was also
built by the same great Constantine, famous for the Coronation of Pietro
Altissiodorensis, Emperor of Constantinople, by Honorius II. It is said
the corpse of St. Stephen, the proto martyr, was deposited here by that
of St. Sebastian, which it had no sooner touched, but Sebastian gave it
place of its own accord. The Church has no less than seven privileged
altars, and excellent pictures. About the walls are painted this
martyr's sufferings; and, when they built them, the bones of divers
saints were translated to other churches. The front is Gothic. In our
return, we saw a small ruin of an aqueduct built by Quintus Marcius, the
prætor; and so passed through that incomparable straight street leading
to Santa Maria Maggiore, to our lodging, sufficiently tired.

We were taken up next morning in seeing the impertinences of the
Carnival, when all the world are as mad at Rome as at other places; but
the most remarkable were the three races of the Barbary horses, that run
in the Strada del Corso without riders, only having spurs so placed on
their backs, and hanging down by their sides, as by their motion to
stimulate them: then of mares, then of asses, of buffalos, naked men, old
and young, and boys, and abundance of idle ridiculous pastime. One thing
is remarkable, their acting comedies on a stage placed on a cart, or
_plaustrum_, where the scene, or tiring place, is made of boughs in a
rural manner, which they drive from street to street with a yoke or two
of oxen, after the ancient guise. The streets swarm with prostitutes,
buffoons, and all manner of rabble.

1st March, 1645. At the Greek Church, we saw the Eastern ceremonies
performed by a Bishop, etc., in that tongue. Here the unfortunate Duke
and Duchess of Bouillon received their ashes, it being the first day of
Lent. There was now as much trudging up and down of devotees, as the day
before of licentious people; all saints alike to appearance.

The gardens of Justinian, which we next visited, are very full of statues
and antiquities, especially urns; among which is that of Minutius Felix;
a terminus that formerly stood in the Appian way, and a huge colossé of
the Emperor Justinian. There is a delicate aviary on the hill; the whole
gardens furnished with rare collections, fresh, shady, and adorned with
noble fountains. Continuing our walk a mile farther, we came to Pons
Milvius, now Mela, where Constantine overthrew Maxentius, and saw the
miraculous sign of the cross, _In hoc signo vinces_. It was a sweet
morning, and the bushes were full of nightingales. Hence, to Aqua Claudia
again, an aqueduct finished by that Emperor at the expense of eight
millions. In the afternoon, to Farnese's gardens, near the Campo
Vaccino; and upon the Palatine Mount to survey the ruins of Juno's
Temple, in the Piscina, a piazza so-called near the famous bridge built
by Antoninus Pius, and re-edified by Pope Sextus IV.

The rest of this week, we went to the Vatican, to hear the sermons, at
St. Peter's, of the most famous preachers, who discourse on the same
subjects and text yearly, full of Italian eloquence and action. On our
Lady day, 25th March, we saw the Pope and Cardinals ride in pomp to the
Minerva, the great guns of the Castle of St. Angelo being fired, when he
gives portions to 500 _zitelle_ (young women), who kiss his feet in
procession, some destined to marry, some to be nuns;--the scholars of the
college celebrating the blessed Virgin with their compositions. The next
day, his Holiness was busied in blessing golden roses, to be sent to
several great Princes; the Procurator of the Carmelites preaching on our
Savior's feeding the multitude with five loaves, the ceremony ends. The
sacrament being this day exposed, and the relics of the Holy Cross, the
concourse about the streets is extraordinary. On Palm-Sunday, there was a
great procession, after a papal mass.

11th April, 1645. St. Veronica's handkerchief (with the impression of our
Savior's face) was exposed, and the next day the spear, with a world of
ceremony. On Holy Thursday, the Pope said mass, and afterward carried the
Host in procession about the chapel, with an infinity of tapers. This
finished, his Holiness was carried in his open chair on men's shoulders
to the place where, reading the Bull _In Coenâ Domini_, he both curses
and blesses all in a breath; then the guns are again fired. Hence, he
went to the Ducal hall of the Vatican, where he washed the feet of twelve
poor men, with almost the same ceremony as it is done at Whitehall; they
have clothes, a dinner, and alms, which he gives with his own hands, and
serves at their table; they have also gold and silver medals, but their
garments are of white woolen long robes, as we paint the Apostles. The
same ceremonies are done by the Conservators and other officers of state
at St. John di Lateran; and now the table on which they say our blessed
Lord celebrated his last supper is set out, and the heads of the
Apostles. In every famous church they are busy in dressing up their
pageantries to represent the Holy Sepulchre, of which we went to visit
divers.

On Good Friday, we went again to St. Peter's, where the handkerchief,
lance, and cross were all exposed, and worshiped together. All the
confession seats were filled with devout people, and at night was a
procession of several who most lamentably whipped themselves till the
blood stained their clothes, for some had shirts, others upon the bare
back, having visors and masks on their faces; at every three or four
steps dashing the knotted and raveled whip cord over their shoulders, as
hard as they could lay it on; while some of the religious orders and
fraternities sung in a dismal tone, the lights and crosses going before,
making all together a horrible and indeed heathenish pomp.

The next day, there was much ceremony at St. John di Laterano, so as the
whole week was spent in running from church to church, all the town in
busy devotion, great silence, and unimaginable superstition.

Easter day, I was awakened by the guns from St. Angelo: we went to St.
Peter's, where the Pope himself celebrated mass, showed the relics
before-named, and gave a public Benediction.

Monday, we went to hear music in the Chiesa Nova; and, though there were
abundance of ceremonies at the other great churches, and great exposure
of relics, yet being wearied with sights of this nature, and the season
of the year, summer, at Rome being very dangerous, by reason of the heat
minding us of returning northward, we spent the rest of our time in
visiting such places as we had not yet sufficiently seen. Only I do not
forget the Pope's benediction of the _Gonfalone_, or Standard, and giving
the hallowed palms; and, on May Day, the great procession of the
University and the muleteers at St. Anthony's, and their setting up a
foolish May pole in the Capitol, very ridiculous. We therefore now took
coach a little out of town, to visit the famous Roma Soterránea, being
much like what we had seen at St. Sebastians. Here, in a cornfield,
guided by two torches, we crept on our bellies into a little hole, about
twenty paces, which delivered us into a large entry that led us into
several streets, or alleys, a good depth in the bowels of the earth, a
strange and fearful passage for divers miles, as Bosio has measured and
described them in his book. We ever and anon came into pretty square
rooms, that seemed to be chapels with altars, and some adorned with very
ordinary ancient painting. Many skeletons and bodies are placed on the
sides one above the other in degrees like shelves, whereof some are shut
up with a coarse flat stone, having engraven on them _Pro Christo_, or a
cross and palms, which are supposed to have been martyrs. Here, in all
likelihood, were the meetings of the Primitive Christians during the
persecutions, as Pliny the Younger describes them. As I was prying about,
I found a glass phial, filled (as was conjectured) with dried blood, and
two lachrymatories. Many of the bodies, or rather bones (for there
appeared nothing else) lay so entire, as if placed by the art of the
chirurgeon, but being only touched fell all to dust. Thus, after
wandering two or three miles in this subterranean meander, we returned
almost blind when we came into the daylight, and even choked by the smoke
of the torches. It is said that a French bishop and his retinue
adventuring too far into these dens, their lights going out, were never
heard of more.

We were entertained at night with an English play at the Jesuits', where
we before had dined; and the next day at Prince Galicano's, who himself
composed the music to a magnificent opera, where were present Cardinal
Pamphilio, the Pope's nephew, the Governors of Rome, the cardinals, the
ambassadors, ladies, and a number of nobility and strangers. There had
been in the morning a joust and tournament of several young gentlemen on
a formal defy, to which we had been invited; the prizes being distributed
by the ladies, after the knight-errantry way. The lancers and swordsmen
running at tilt against the barriers, with a great deal of clatter, but
without any bloodshed, giving much diversion to the spectators, and was
new to us travelers.

The next day Mr. Henshaw and I spent the morning in attending the
entrance and cavalcade of Cardinal Medici, the ambassador from the Grand
Duke of Florence, by the Via Flaminia. After dinner, we went again to the
Villa Borghese, about a mile without the city; the garden is rather a
park, or a Paradise, contrived and planted with walks and shades of
myrtles, cypress, and other trees, and groves, with abundance of
fountains, statues, and bass-relievos, and several pretty murmuring
rivulets. Here they had hung large nets to catch woodcocks. There was
also a vivary, where, among other exotic fowls, was an ostrich; besides a
most capacious aviary; and, in another inclosed part, a herd of deer.
Before the palace (which might become the court of a great prince) stands
a noble fountain, of white marble, enriched with statues. The outer walls
of the house are encrusted with excellent antique bass-relievos, of the
same marble, incornished with festoons and niches set with statues from
the foundation to the roof. A stately portico joins the palace, full of
statues and columns of marble, urns, and other curiosities of sculpture.
In the first hall were the Twelve Cæsars, of antique marble, and the
whole apartments furnished with pictures of the most celebrated masters,
and two rare tables of porphyry, of great value. But of this already: for
I often visited this delicious place.

This night were glorious fire-works at the palace of Cardinal Medici
before the gate, and lights of several colors all about the windows
through the city, which they contrive by setting the candles in little
paper lanterns dyed with various colors, placing hundreds of them from
story to story; which renders a gallant show.

4th May, 1645. Having seen the entry of the ambassador of Lucca, I went
to the Vatican, where, by favor of our Cardinal Protector, Fran.
Barberini, I was admitted into the Consistory, heard the ambassador make
his oration in Latin to the Pope, sitting on an elevated state, or
throne, and changing two pontifical mitres; after which, I was presented
to kiss his toe, that is, his embroidered slipper, two Cardinals holding
up his vest and surplice; and then, being sufficiently blessed with his
thumb and two fingers for that day I returned home to dinner.

We went again to see the medals of Signor Gotefredi, which are absolutely
the best collection in Rome.

Passing the Ludovisia Villa, where the petrified human figure lies, found
on the snowy Alps; I measured the hydra, and found it not a foot long;
the three necks and fifteen heads seem to be but patched up with several
pieces of serpents' skins.

5th May, 1645. We took coach, and went fifteen miles out of the city to
Frascati, formerly Tusculum, a villa of Cardinal Aldobrandini, built for
a country house; but surpassing, in my opinion, the most delicious places
I ever beheld for its situation, elegance, plentiful water, groves,
ascents, and prospects. Just behind the palace (which is of excellent
architecture) in the centre of the inclosure, rises a high hill, or
mountain, all over clad with tall wood, and so formed by nature, as if it
had been cut out by art, from the summit whereof falls a cascade, seeming
rather a great river than a stream precipitating into a large theatre of
water, representing an exact and perfect rainbow, when the sun shines
out. Under this, is made an artificial grot, wherein are curious rocks,
hydraulic organs, and all sorts of singing birds, moving and chirping by
force of the water, with several other pageants and surprising
inventions. In the centre of one of these rooms, rises a copper ball that
continually dances about three feet above the pavement, by virtue of a
wind conveyed secretly to a hole beneath it; with many other devices to
wet the unwary spectators, so that one can hardly step without wetting to
the skin. In one of these theaters of water, is an Atlas spouting up the
stream to a very great height; and another monster makes a terrible
roaring with a horn; but, above all, the representation of a storm is
most natural, with such fury of rain, wind, and thunder, as one would
imagine oneself in some extreme tempest. The garden has excellent walks
and shady groves, abundance of rare fruit, oranges, lemons, etc., and the
goodly prospect of Rome, above all description, so as I do not wonder
that Cicero and others have celebrated this place with such encomiums.
The Palace is indeed built more like a cabinet than anything composed of
stone and mortar; it has in the middle a hall furnished with excellent
marbles and rare pictures, especially those of Gioseppino d'Arpino; the
movables are princely and rich. This was the last piece of architecture
finished by Giacomo della Porta, who built it for Pietro Cardinal
Aldobrandini, in the time of Clement VIII.[29]

    [Footnote 29: Cardinal Hippolito Aldobrandini was elected Pope in
    January, 1592, by the name of Clement VIII., and died in March,
    1605.]

We went hence to another house and garden not far distant, on the side of
a hill called Mondragone, finished by Cardinal Scipio Borghese, an ample
and kingly edifice. It has a very long gallery, and at the end a theatre
for pastimes, spacious courts, rare grots, vineyards, olive-grounds,
groves and solitudes. The air is so fresh and sweet, as few parts of
Italy exceed it; nor is it inferior to any palace in the city itself for
statues, pictures, and furniture; but, it growing late, we could not take
such particular notice of these things as they deserved.

[Sidenote: TIVOLI]

6th May, 1645. We rested ourselves; and next day, in a coach, took our
last farewell of visiting the circumjacent places, going to Tivoli, or
the old Tiburtum. At about six miles from Rome, we pass the Teverone, a
bridge built by Mammea, the mother of Severus, and so by divers ancient
sepulchres, among others that of Valerius Volusi; and near it past the
stinking sulphurous river over the Ponte Lucano, where we found a heap, or
turret, full of inscriptions, now called the Tomb of Plautius. Arrived at
Tivoli, we went first to see the palace d'Este, erected on a plain, but
where was formerly an hill. The palace is very ample and stately. In the
garden, on the right hand, are sixteen vast conchas of marble, jetting
out waters; in the midst of these stands a Janus quadrifrons, that cast
forth four girandolas, called from the resemblance (to a particular
exhibition in fireworks so named) the Fountana di Spéccho
(looking-glass). Near this is a place for tilting. Before the ascent of
the palace is the famous fountain of Leda, and not far from that, four
sweet and delicious gardens. Descending thence are two pyramids of water,
and in a grove of trees near it the fountains of Tethys, Esculapius,
Arethusa, Pandora, Pomona, and Flora; then the prancing Pegasus, Bacchus,
the Grot of Venus, the two Colosses of Melicerta and Sibylla Tiburtina,
all of exquisite marble, copper, and other suitable adornments. The
Cupids pouring out water are especially most rare, and the urns on which
are placed the ten nymphs. The grots are richly paved with
_pietra-commessa_, shells, coral, etc.

Toward Roma Triumphans, leads a long and spacious walk, full of
fountains, under which is historized the whole Ovidian Metamorphosis, in
rarely sculptured _mezzo relievo_. At the end of this, next the wall, is
the city of Rome as it was in its beauty, of small models, representing
that city, with its amphitheatres; naumachi, thermæ, temples, arches,
aqueducts, streets, and other magnificences, with a little stream running
through it for the Tiber, gushing out of an urn next to the statue of the
river. In another garden, is a noble aviary, the birds artificial, and
singing till an owl appears, on which they suddenly change their notes.
Near this is the fountain of dragons, casting out large streams of water
with great noise. In another grotto, called Grotto di Natura, is an
hydraulic organ; and below this are divers stews and fish ponds, in one
of which is the statue of Neptune in his chariot on a seahorse, in
another a Triton; and lastly, a garden of simples. There are besides in
the palace many rare statues and pictures, bedsteads richly inlaid, and
sundry other precious movables: the whole is said to have cost the best
part of a million.

Having gratified our curiosity with these artificial miracles, and dined,
we went to see the so famous natural precipice and cascade of the river
Anio, rushing down from the mountains of Tivoli with that fury that, what
with the mist it perpetually casts up by the breaking of the water
against the rocks, and what with the sun shining on it and forming a
natural Iris, and the prodigious depth of the gulf below, it is enough to
astonish one that looks on it. Upon the summit of this rock stands the
ruins and some pillars and cornices of the Temple of Sibylla Tyburtina,
or Albunea, a round fabric, still discovering some of its pristine
beauty. Here was a great deal of gunpowder drying in the sun, and a
little beneath, mills belonging to the Pope.

[Sidenote: ROME]

And now we returned to Rome. By the way, we were showed, at some
distance, the city Præneste, and the Hadrian villa, now only a heap of
ruins; and so came late to our lodging.

We now determined to desist from visiting any more curiosities, except
what should happen to come in our way, when my companion, Mr. Henshaw, or
myself should go to take the air: only I may not omit that one afternoon,
diverting ourselves in the Piazza Navona, a mountebank there to allure
curious strangers, taking off a ring from his finger, which seemed set
with a dull, dark stone a little swelling out, like what we call (though
untruly) a toadstone, and wetting his finger a little in his mouth, and
then touching it, it emitted a luculent flame as bright and large as a
small wax candle; then, blowing it out, repeated this several times. I
have much regretted that I did not purchase the receipt of him for making
that composition at what price soever; for though there is a process in
Jo. Baptista Porta and others how to do it, yet on several trials they
none of them have succeeded.

Among other observations I made in Rome are these: as to coins and
medals, ten _asses_ make the Roman _denarius_, five the _quinarius_, ten
_denarii_ an _aureus_; which accompt runs almost exactly with what is now
in use of _quatrini_, _baiocs_, _julios_, and _scudi_, each exceeding the
other in the proportion of ten. The _sestertius_ was a small silver coin,
marked H. S. or rather LL^s, valued two pounds and a half of silver, viz,
250 _denarii_, about twenty-five golden _ducati_. The stamp of the Roman
_denarius_ varied, having sometimes a Janus bifrons, the head of Roma
armed, or with a chariot and two horses, which were called _bigi_; if
with four, _quadrigi_: if with a Victoria, so named. The mark of the
_denarius_ was distinguished > | < thus, or X; the _quinarius_ of half
value, had, on one side, the head of Rome and V; the reverse, Castor and
Pollux on horseback, inscribed _Roma_, etc.

I observed that in the Greek church they made the sign of the cross from
the right hand to the left; contrary to the Latins and the schismatic
Greeks; gave the benediction with the first, second, and little finger
stretched out, retaining the third bent down, expressing a distance of
the third Person of the Holy Trinity from the first two.

[Illustration: _LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL TAKING LEAVE OF HIS CHILDREN, 1683_

_Photogravure after a painting by Bridges_]

For sculptors and architects, we found Bernini and Algardi were in the
greatest esteem; Fiamingo, as a statuary; who made the Andrea in St.
Peter's, and is said to have died mad because it was placed in an ill
light. Among the painters, Antonio de la Cornea, who has such an address
of counterfeiting the hands of the ancient masters so well as to make his
copies pass for originals; Pietro de Cortone, Monsieur Poussin, a
Frenchman, and innumerable more. Fioravanti, for armor, plate, dead life,
tapestry, etc. The chief masters of music, after Marc Antonio, the best
treble, is Cavalier Lauretto, an eunuch; the next Cardinal Bichi's
eunuch, Bianchi, tenor, and Nicholai, bass. The Jews in Rome wore
red hats, till the Cardinal of Lyons, being short-sighted, lately saluted
one of them, thinking him to be a Cardinal as he passed by his coach; on
which an order was made, that they should use only the yellow color.
There was now at Rome one Mrs. Ward, an English devotée, who much
solicited for an order of Jesuitesses.

At executions I saw one, a gentleman, hanged in his cloak and hat for
murder. They struck the malefactor with a club that first stunned him,
and then cut his throat. At Naples they use a frame, like ours at
Halifax.[30]

    [Footnote 30: A guillotine.]

It is reported that Rome has been once no less than fifty miles in
compass, now not thirteen, containing in it 3,000 churches and chapels,
monasteries, etc. It is divided into fourteen regions or wards; has seven
mountains, and as many campi or valleys; in these are fair parks, or
gardens, called villas, being only places of recess and pleasure, at some
distance from the streets, yet within the walls.

The bills of exchange I took up from my first entering Italy till I went
from Rome, amounting to but 616 _ducati di banco_, though I purchased
many books, pictures, and curiosities.

18th May, 1645. I intended to have seen Loretto, but, being disappointed
of moneys long expected, I was forced to return by the same way I came,
desiring, if possible, to be at Venice by the Ascension, and therefore I
diverted to take Leghorn in the way, as well to furnish me with credit by
a merchant there, as to take order for transporting such collections as I
had made at Rome. When on my way, turning about to behold this once and
yet glorious city, from an eminence, I did not, without some regret, give
it my last farewell.

Having taken leave of our friends at Rome, where I had sojourned now
about seven months, autumn, winter, and spring, I took coach, in company
with two courteous Italian gentlemen. In the afternoon, we arrived at a
house, or rather castle, belonging to the Duke of Parma, called
Caprarola, situate on the brow of a hill, that overlooks a little town,
or rather a natural and stupendous rock; witness those vast caves serving
now for cellarage, where we were entertained with most generous wine of
several sorts, being just under the foundation. The palace was built by
the famous architect, Vignola, at the cost of Cardinal Alex. Farnese, in
form of an octagon, the court in the middle being exactly round, so as
rather to resemble a fort, or castle; yet the chambers within are all of
them square, which makes the walls exceedingly thick. One of these rooms
is so artificially contrived, that from the two opposite angles may be
heard the least whisper; they say any perfect square does it. Most of the
paintings are by Zuccari. It has a stately entry, on which spouts an
artificial fountain within the porch. The hall, chapel, and a great
number of lodging chambers are remarkable; but most of all the pictures
and witty inventions of Hannibal Caracci; the Dead Christ is
incomparable. Behind are the gardens full of statues and noble fountains,
especially that of the Shepherds. After dinner, we took horse, and lay
that night at Monte Rossi, twenty miles from Rome.

19th May, 1645. We dined at Viterbo, and lay at St. Laurenzo. Next day,
at Radicofani, and slept at Turnera.

[Sidenote: SIENNA]

21st May, 1645. We dined at Sienna, where we could not pass admiring the
great church built entirely both within and without with white and black
marble in polished squares, by Macarino, showing so beautiful after a
shower has fallen. The floor within is of various colored marbles,
representing the story of both Testaments, admirably wrought. Here lies
Pius II. The bibliotéca is painted by P. Perrugino and Raphael. The life
of Æneas Sylvius is in FRESCO; in the middle are the Three Graces, in
antique marble, very curious, and the front of this building, though
Gothic, is yet very fine. Among other things, they show St. Catharine's
disciplining cell, the door whereof is half cut out into chips by the
pilgrims and devotees, being of deal wood.

Setting out hence for Pisa, we went again to see the Duomo in which the
Emperor Henry VII. lies buried, poisoned by a monk in the Eucharist. The
bending tower was built by Busqueto Delichio, a Grecian architect, and is
a stupendous piece of art. In the gallery of curiosities is a fair mummy;
the tail of a sea-horse; coral growing on a man's skull; a chariot
automaton; two pieces of rock crystal, in one of which is a drop of
water, in the other three or four small worms; two embalmed children;
divers petrifactions, etc. The garden of simples is well furnished, and
has in it the deadly yew, or _taxus_, of the ancients; which Dr.
Belluccio, the superintendent, affirms that his workmen cannot endure to
clip for above the space of half an hour at a time, from the pain of the
head which surprises them.

We went hence from Leghorn, by coach, where I took up ninety crowns for
the rest of my journey, with letters of credit for Venice, after I had
sufficiently complained of my defeat of correspondence at Rome.

The next day, I came to Lucca, a small but pretty territory and state of
itself. The city is neat and well fortified, with noble and pleasant
walks of trees on the works, where the gentry and ladies used to take the
air. It is situate on an ample plain by the river Serchio, yet the
country about it is hilly. The Senate-house is magnificent. The church of
St. Michael is a noble piece, as is also St. Fredian, more remarkable to
us for the corpse of St. Richard, an English king,[31] who died here on
his pilgrimage toward Rome. This epitaph is on his tomb:

    _Hic rex Richardus requiescit, sceptifer, almus;
    Rex Fuit Anglorum; regnum tenet iste Polorum.
    Regnum demisit; pro Christo cuncta reliquit.
    Ergo, Richardum nobis debit Anglia sanctum.
    Hic genitor Sanctæ Wulburgæ Virginis almæ
    Est Vrillebaldi sancti simul et Vinebaldi,
    Suffragium quorum nobis det regna Polorum._

    [Footnote 31: What particular Richard King of England this was, it
    is impossible to say; the tomb still exists, and has long been a
    _crux_ to antiquaries and travelers.]

Next this, we visited St. Croce, an excellent structure all of marble
both without and within, and so adorned as may vie with many of the
fairest even in Rome: witness the huge cross, valued at £15,000, above
all venerable for that sacred _volto_ which (as tradition goes) was
miraculously put on the image of Christ, and made by Nicodemus, while the
artist, finishing the rest of the body, was meditating what face to set
on it. The inhabitants are exceedingly civil to strangers, above all
places in Italy, and they speak the purest Italian. It is also cheap
living, which causes travelers to set up their rest here more than in
Florence, though a more celebrated city; besides, the ladies here are
very conversable, and the religious women not at all reserved; of these
we bought gloves and embroidered stomachers, generally worn by gentlemen
in these countries. The circuit of this state is but two easy days'
journey, and lies mixed with the Duke of Tuscany's but having Spain for a
protector (though the least bigoted of all Roman Catholics), and being
one of the fortified cities in Italy, it remains in peace. The whole
country abounds in excellent olives, etc.

[Sidenote: PISTORIA]

Going hence for Florence, we dined at Pistoria, where, besides one
church, there was little observable: only in the highway we crossed a
rivulet of salt water, though many miles from the sea. The country is
extremely pleasant, full of gardens, and the roads straight as a line for
the best part of that whole day, the hedges planted with trees at equal
distances, watered with clear and plentiful streams.

Rising early the next morning we arrived at Peggio Imperiale, being a
palace of the Great Duke, not far from the city, having omitted it in my
passage to Rome. The ascent to the house is by a stately gallery as it
were of tall and overgrown cypress trees for near half a mile. At the
entrance of these ranges, are placed statues of the Tiber and Arno, of
marble; those also of Virgil, Ovid, Petrarch, and Dante. The building is
sumptuous, and curiously furnished within with cabinets of
pietra-commessa in tables, pavements, etc., which is a magnificence, or
work, particularly affected at Florence. The pictures are, Adam and Eve
by Albert Durer, very excellent; as is that piece of carving in wood by
the same hand standing in a cupboard. Here is painted the whole Austrian
line; the Duke's mother, sister to the Emperor, the foundress of this
palace, than which there is none in Italy that I had seen more
magnificently adorned, or furnished.

[Sidenote: FLORENCE]

We could not omit in our passage to re-visit the same, and other
curiosities which we had neglected on our first being at Florence. We
went, therefore, to see the famous piece of Andrea del Sarto, in the
Annunciata. The story is, that the painter in a time of dearth borrowed a
sack of corn of the religious of that convent, and repayment being
demanded, he wrought it out in this picture, which represents Joseph
sitting on a sack of corn, and reading to the Blessed Virgin; a piece
infinitely valued. There fell down in the cloister an old man's face
painted on the wall in _fresco_, greatly esteemed, and broke into crumbs;
the Duke sent his best painters to make another instead of it, but none
of them would presume to touch a pencil where Andrea had wrought, like
another Apelles; but one of them was so industrious and patient, that,
picking up the fragments, he laid and fastened them so artificially
together, that the injury it had received was hardly discernible. Andrea
del Sarto lies buried in the same place. Here is also that picture of
Bartolomeo, who having spent his utmost skill in the face of the angel
Gabriel, and being troubled that he could not exceed it in the Virgin, he
began the body and to finish the clothes, and so left it, minding in the
morning to work on the face; but, when he came, no sooner had he drawn
away the cloth that was hung before it to preserve it from the dust, than
an admirable and ravishing face was found ready painted; at which miracle
all the city came in to worship. It is now kept in the Chapel of the
Salutation, a place so enriched by devotees, that none in Italy, save
Loretto, is said to exceed it. This picture is always covered with three
shutters, one of which is of massy silver; methinks it is very brown, the
forehead and cheeks whiter, as if it had been scraped. They report that
those who have the honor of seeing it never lose their sight--happy then
we! Belonging to this church is a world of plate, some whole statues of
it, and lamps innumerable, besides the costly vows hung up, some of gold,
and a cabinet of precious stones.

Visiting the Duke's repository again, we told at least forty ranks of
porphyry and other statues, and twenty-eight whole figures, many rare
paintings and relievos, two square columns with trophies. In one of the
galleries, twenty-four figures, and fifty antique heads; a Bacchus of M.
Angelo, and one of Bandinelli; a head of Bernini, and a most lovely
Cupid, of Parian marble; at the further end, two admirable women sitting,
and a man fighting with a centaur; three figures in little of Andrea; a
huge candlestick of amber; a table of Titian's painting, and another
representing God the Father sitting in the air on the Four Evangelists;
animals; divers smaller pieces of Raphael; a piece of pure virgin gold,
as big as an egg. In the third chamber of rarities is the square
cabinet, valued at 80,000 crowns, showing on every front, a variety of
curious work; one of birds and flowers, of _pietra-commessa_; one, a
descent from the cross, of M. Angelo; on the third, our Blessed Savior
and the Apostles, of amber; and, on the fourth, a crucifix of the same.
Between the pictures, two naked Venuses, by Titian; Adam and Eve, by
Durer; and several pieces of Portdenone, and del Frate. There is a globe
of six feet diameter. In the Armory, were an entire elk, a crocodile, and
among the harness, several targets and antique horse-arms, as that of
Charles V.; two set with turquoises, and other precious stones; a horse's
tail, of a wonderful length. Then, passing the Old Palace, which has a
very great hall for feasts and comedies, the roof rarely painted, and the
side walls with six very large pictures representing battles, the work of
Gio. Vassari. Here is a magazine full of plate; a harness of emeralds;
the furnitures of an altar four feet high, and six in length, of massy
gold; in the middle is placed the statue of Cosmo II., the bass-relievo
is of precious stones, his breeches covered with diamonds; the moldings
of this statue, and other ornaments, festoons, etc., are garnished with
jewels and great pearls, dedicated to St. Charles, with this inscription,
in rubies:

    "_Cosimus Secundus Dei gratiâ Magnus Dux Etruriæ ex voto._"

There is also a King on horseback, of massy gold, two feet high, and an
infinity of such like rarities. Looking at the Justice, in copper, set up
on a column by Cosmo, in 1555, after the victory over Sienna, we were
told that the Duke, asking a gentleman how he liked the piece, he
answered, that he liked it very well, but that it stood too high for poor
men to come at it.

Prince Leopold has, in this city, a very excellent collection of
paintings, especially a St. Catherine of P. Veronese; a Venus of marble,
veiled from the middle to the feet, esteemed to be of that Greek workman
who made the Venus at the Medici's Palace in Rome, altogether as good,
and better preserved, an inestimable statue, not long since found about
Bologna.

Signor Gaddi is a lettered person, and has divers rarities, statues, and
pictures of the best masters, and one bust of marble as much esteemed as
the most antique in Italy, and many curious manuscripts; his best
paintings are, a Virgin of del Sarto, mentioned by Vassari, a St. John,
by Raphael, and an _Ecce Homo_, by Titian.

The hall of the Academy de la Crusca is hung about with impresses and
devices painted, all of them relating to corn sifted from the bran; the
seats are made like breadbaskets and other rustic instruments used about
wheat, and the cushions of satin, like sacks.

We took our farewell of St. Laurence, more particularly noticing that
piece of the Resurrection, which consists of a prodigious number of naked
figures, the work of Pontormo. On the left hand is the Martyrdom of St.
Laurence, by Bronzino, rarely painted indeed. In a chapel is the tomb of
Pietro di Medici, and his brother John, of copper, excellently designed,
standing on two lions' feet, which end in foliage, the work of M. Angelo.
Over against this, are sepulchres of all the ducal family. The altar has
a statue of the Virgin giving suck, and two Apostles. Paulus Jovius has
the honor to be buried in the cloister. Behind the choir is the superb
chapel of Ferdinand I., consisting of eight faces, four plain, four a
little hollowed; in the other are to be the sepulchres, and a niche of
paragon, for the statue of the prince now living, all of copper gilt;
above, is a large table of porphyry, for an inscription for the Duke, in
letters of jasper. The whole chapel, walls, pavement, and roof, are full
of precious stones united with the moldings, which are also of gilded
copper, and so are the bases and capitals of the columns. The tabernacle,
with the whole altar, is inlaid with cornelians, lazuli, serpentine,
agates, onyxes, etc. On the other side are six very large columns of rock
crystal, eight figures of precious stones of several colors, inlaid in
natural figures, not inferior to the best paintings, among which are many
pearls, diamonds, amethysts, topazes, sumptuous and sparkling beyond
description. The windows without side are of white marble. The library is
the architecture of Raphael; before the port is a square vestibule of
excellent art, of all the orders, without confusion; the ascent to it
from the library is excellent. We numbered eighty-eight shelves, all MSS.
and bound in red, chained; in all about 3,500 volumes, as they told us.

The Arsenal has sufficient to arm 70,000 men, accurately preserved and
kept, with divers lusty pieces of ordnance, whereof one is for a ball of
300 pounds weight, and another for 160, which weighs 72,500 pounds.

When I was at Florence, the celebrated masters were: for
_pietra-commessa_ (a kind of mosaic, or inlaying, of various colored
marble, and other more precious stones), Dominico Benetti and Mazotti;
the best statuary, Vincentio Brochi. This statuary makes those small
figures in plaster and pasteboard, which so resemble copper that, till
one handles them, they cannot be distinguished, he has so rare an art of
bronzing them; I bought four of him. The best painter, Pietro Beretino di
Cortona.

This Duke has a daily tribute for every courtezan, or prostitute, allowed
to practice that infamous trade in his dominions, and so has his Holiness
the Pope, but not so much in value.

[Sidenote: BOLOGNA]

Taking leave of our two jolly companions, Signor Giovanni and his fellow,
we took horses for Bologna; and, by the way, alighted at a villa of the
Grand Duke's, called Pratolino. The house is a square of four pavilions,
with a fair platform about it, balustred with stone, situate in a large
meadow, ascending like an amphitheater, having at the bottom a huge rock,
with water running in a small channel, like a cascade; on the other side,
are the gardens. The whole place seems consecrated to pleasure and summer
retirement. The inside of the palace may compare with any in Italy for
furniture of tapestry, beds, etc., and the gardens are delicious, and
full of fountains. In the grove sits Pan feeding his flock, the water
making a melodious sound through his pipe; and a Hercules, whose club
yields a shower of water, which, falling into a great shell, has a naked
woman riding on the backs of dolphins. In another grotto is Vulcan and
his family, the walls richly composed of corals, shells, copper, and
marble figures, with the hunting of several beasts, moving by the force
of water. Here, having been well washed for our curiosity, we went down a
large walk, at the sides whereof several slender streams of water gush
out of pipes concealed underneath, that interchangeably fall into each
other's channels, making a lofty and perfect arch, so that a man on
horseback may ride under it, and not receive one drop of wet. This
canopy, or arch of water, I thought one of the most surprising
magnificences I had ever seen, and very refreshing in the heat of the
summer. At the end of this very long walk, stands a woman in white
marble, in posture of a laundress wringing water out of a piece of linen,
very naturally formed, into a vast laver, the work and invention of M.
Angelo Buonarotti. Hence, we ascended Mount Parnassus, where the Muses
played to us on hydraulic organs. Near this is a great aviary. All these
waters came from the rock in the garden, on which is the statue of a
giant representing the Apennines, at the foot of which stands this villa.
Last of all, we came to the labyrinth, in which a huge colosse of Jupiter
throws out a stream over the garden. This is fifty feet in height, having
in his body a square chamber, his eyes and mouth serving for windows and
door.

We took horse and supped that night at Il Ponte, passing a dreadful ridge
of the Apennines, in many places capped with snow, which covers them the
whole summer. We then descended into a luxurious and rich plain. The next
day we passed through Scarperia, mounting the hills again, where the
passage is so straight and precipitous toward the right hand, that we
climbed them with much care and danger; lodging at Firenzuolo, which is a
fort built among the rocks, and defending the confines of the Great
Duke's territories.

The next day we passed by the Pietramala, a burning mountain. At the
summit of this prodigious mass of hills, we had an unpleasant way to
Pianura, where we slept that night and were entertained with excellent
wine. Hence to Scargalasino, and to bed at Loiano. This plain begins
about six miles from Bologna.

Bologna belongs to the Pope, and is a famous University, situate in one
of the richest spots of Europe for all sorts of provisions. It is built
like a ship, whereof the Torre d'Asinelli may go for the mainmast. The
city is of no great strength, having a trifling wall about it, in circuit
near five miles, and two in length. This Torre d'Asinelli, ascended by
447 steps of a foot rise, seems exceedingly high, is very narrow, and the
more conspicuous from another tower called Garisendi, so artificially
built of brick (which increases the wonder) that it seems ready to fall.
It is not now so high as the other; but they say the upper part was
formerly taken down, for fear it should really fall, and do mischief.

Next, we went to see an imperfect church, called St. Petronius, showing
the intent of the founder, had he gone on. From this, our guide led us to
the schools, which indeed are very magnificent. Thence to St. Dominic's,
where that saint's body lies richly enshrined. The stalls, or seats, of
this goodly church have the history of the Bible inlaid with several
woods, very curiously done, the work of one Fr. Damiano di Bergamo, and a
friar of that order. Among other relics, they show the two books of
Esdras, written with his own hand. Here lie buried Jac. Andreas, and
divers other learned persons. To the church joins the convent, in the
quadrangle whereof are old cypresses, said to have been planted by their
saint.

Then we went to the palace of the Legate; a fair brick building, as are
most of the houses and buildings, full of excellent carving and moldings,
so as nothing in stone seems to be better finished or more ornamental;
witness those excellent columns to be seen in many of their churches,
convents, and public buildings; for the whole town is so cloistered, that
one may pass from house to house through the streets without being
exposed either to rain or sun.

Before the stately hall of this palace stands the statue of Paul IV. and
divers others; also the monument of the coronation of Charles V. The
piazza before it is the most stately in Italy, St. Mark's at Venice only
excepted. In the center of it is a fountain of Neptune, a noble figure in
copper. Here I saw a Persian walking about in a rich vest of cloth of
tissue, and several other ornaments, according to the fashion of his
country, which much pleased me; he was a young handsome person, of the
most stately mien.

I would fain have seen the library of St. Savior, famous for the number
of rare manuscripts; but could not, so we went to St. Francis, a glorious
pile, and exceedingly adorned within.

After dinner I inquired out a priest and Dr. Montalbano, to whom I
brought recommendations from Rome: this learned person invented, or found
out, the composition of the _lapis illuminabilis_, or phosphorus. He
showed me their property (for he had several), being to retain the light
of the sun for some competent time, by a kind of imbibition, by a
particular way of calcination. Some of these presented a blue color,
like the flame of brimstone, others like coals of a kitchen fire. The
rest of the afternoon was taken up in St. Michael in Bosco, built on a
steep hill on the edge of the city, for its fabric, pleasant shade and
groves, cellars, dormitory, and prospects, one of the most delicious
retirements I ever saw; art and nature contending which shall exceed; so
as till now I never envied the life of a friar. The whole town and
country to a vast extent are under command of their eyes, almost as far
as Venice itself. In this convent there are many excellent paintings of
Guido Reni; above all, the little cloister of eight faces, painted by
Caracci in _fresco_. The carvings in wood, in the sacristy, are
admirable, as is the inlaid work about the chapel, which even emulates
the best paintings; the work is so delicate and tender. The paintings of
the Savior are of Caracci and Leonardo, and there are excellent things of
Raphael which we could not see.

In the church of St. John is a fine piece of St. Cecilia, by Raphael. As
to other paintings, there is in the church of St. Gregory an excellent
picture of a Bishop giving the habit of St. Bernard to an armed soldier,
with several other figures in the piece, the work of Guerchino. Indeed,
this city is full of rare pieces, especially of Guido Domenico, and a
virgin named Isabella Sirani, now living, who has painted many excellent
pieces, and imitates Guido so well, that many skillful artists have been
deceived.

At the Mendicants are the Miracles of St. Eloy, by Reni, after the manner
of Caravaggio, but better; and here they showed us that famous piece of
Christ calling St. Matthew, by Annibal Caracci. The Marquis Magniani has
the whole frieze of his hall painted in _fresco_ by the same hand.

Many of the religious men nourish those lapdogs which the ladies are so
fond of, and which they here sell. They are a pigmy sort of spaniels,
whose noses they break when puppies; which, in my opinion, deforms them.

At the end of the turning in one of the wings of the dormitory of St.
Michael, I found a paper pasted near the window, containing the
dimensions of most of the famous churches in Italy compared with their
towers here, and the length of this gallery, a copy whereof I took.

      [Footnote 32: A measure of half an ell.]

From hence being brought to a subterranean territory of cellars, the
courteous friars made us taste a variety of excellent wines; and so we
departed to our inn.

The city is famous also for sausages; and here is sold great quantities
of Parmegiano cheese, with Botargo, Caviare, etc., which makes some of
their shops perfume the streets with no agreeable smell. We furnished
ourselves with wash balls, the best being made here, and being a
considerable commodity. This place has also been celebrated for lutes
made by the old masters, Mollen, Hans Frey, and Nicholas Sconvelt, which
were of extraordinary price; the workmen were chiefly Germans. The cattle
used for draught in this country (which is very rich and fertile,
especially in pasturage) are covered with housings of linen fringed at
the bottom, that dangle about them, preserving them from flies, which in
summer are very troublesome.

[Sidenote: FERRARA]

From this pleasant city, we proceeded toward Ferrara, carrying with us a
bulletino, or bill of health (customary in all these parts of Italy,
especially in the State of Venice) and so put ourselves into a boat that
was towed with horses, often interrupted by the sluices (inventions there
to raise the water for the use of mills, and to fill the artificial
canals) at each of which we stayed till passage was made. We went by the
Castle Bentivoglio, and, about night arrived at an ugly inn called _Mal
Albergo_, agreeable to its name, whence, after we had supped, we embarked
and passed that night through the Fens, where we were so pestered with
those flying glow-worms, called _Luccioli_, that one who had never heard
of them, would think the country full of sparks of fire. Beating some of
them down and applying them to a book, I could read in the dark by the
light they afforded.

Quitting our boat, we took coach, and by morning got to Ferrara, where,
before we could gain entrance, our guns and arms were taken from us of
custom, the lock being taken off before, as we were advised. The city is
in a low marshy country, and therefore well fortified. The houses and
streets have nothing of beauty, except the palace and church of St.
Benedict, where Ariosto lies buried, and there are some good statues, the
palazzo del Diamante, citadel, church of St. Dominico. The market-place
is very spacious, having in its centre the figure of Nicholao Oläo once
Duke of Ferrara, on horseback, in copper. It is, in a word, a dirty town,
and, though the streets be large they remain ill paved; yet it is a
University and now belongs to the Pope. Though there are not many fine
houses in the city, the inn where we lodged was a very noble palace,
having an Angel for its sign.

[Sidenote: VENICE]

We parted from hence about three in the afternoon, and went some of our
way on the canal, and then embarked on the Po; or Padus; by the poets
called Eridanus, where they feign Phæton to have fallen after his rash
attempt, and where Io was metamorphosed into a cow. There was in our
company, among others, a Polonian Bishop, who was exceeding civil to me
in this passage, and afterward did me many kindnesses at Venice. We
supped this night at a place called Corbua, near the ruins of the ancient
city, Adria, which gives name to the Gulf, or Sea. After three miles,
having passed thirty on the Po, we embarked in a stout vessel, and
through an artificial canal, very straight, we entered the Adige, which
carried us by break of day into the Adriatic, and so sailing prosperously
by Chioza (a town upon an island in this sea), and Palestina, we came
over against Malamocco (the chief port and anchorage where our English
merchantmen lie that trade to Venice) about seven at night, after we had
stayed at least two hours for permission to land, our bill of health
being delivered, according to custom. So soon as we came on shore, we
were conducted to the Dogana, where our portmanteaus were visited, and
then we got to our lodging, which was at honest Signor Paulo Rhodomante's
at the Black Eagle, near the Rialto, one of the best quarters of the
town. This journey from Rome to Venice cost me seven pistoles, and
thirteen julios.

June, 1645. The next morning, finding myself extremely weary and beaten
with my journey, I went to one of their bagnios, where you are treated
after the eastern manner, washing with hot and cold water, with oils, and
being rubbed with a kind of strigil of seal-skin, put on the operator's
hand like a glove. This bath did so open my pores, that it cost me one of
the greatest colds I ever had in my life, for want of necessary caution
in keeping myself warm for some time after; for, coming out, I
immediately began to visit the famous places of the city; and travelers
who come into Italy do nothing but run up and down to see sights, and
this city well deserved our admiration, being the most wonderfully placed
of any in the world, built on so many hundred islands, in the very sea,
and at good distance from the continent. It has no fresh water except
what is reserved in cistern from rain, and such as is daily brought from
_terra firma_ in boats, yet there was no want of it, and all sorts of
excellent provisions were very cheap.

It is said that when the Huns overran Italy, some mean fishermen and
others left the mainland, and fled for shelter to these despicable and
muddy islands, which, in process of time, by industry, are grown to the
greatness of one of the most considerable States, considered as a
Republic, and having now subsisted longer than any of the four ancient
Monarchies, flourishing in great state, wealth, and glory, by the
conquest of great territories in Italy, Dacia, Greece, Candia, Rhodes,
and Sclavonia, and at present challenging the empire of all the Adriatic
Sea, which they yearly espouse by casting a gold ring into it with great
pomp and ceremony, on Ascension-day; the desire of seeing this was one of
the reasons that hastened us from Rome.

The Doge, having heard mass in his robes of state (which are very
particular, after the eastern fashion), together with the Senate in their
gowns, embarked in their gloriously painted, carved, and gilded
Bucentora, environed and followed by innumerable galleys, gondolas, and
boats, filled with spectators, some dressed in masquerade, trumpets,
music, and cannons. Having rowed about a league into the Gulf, the Duke,
at the prow, casts a gold ring and cup into the sea, at which a loud
acclamation is echoed from the great guns of the Arsenal, and at the
Liddo. We then returned.

Two days after, taking a gondola, which is their water-coach (for land
ones, there are many old men in this city who never saw one, or rarely a
horse), we rode up and down the channels, which answer to our streets.
These vessels are built very long and narrow, having necks and tails of
steel, somewhat spreading at the beak like a fish's tail, and kept so
exceedingly polished as to give a great lustre; some are adorned with
carving, others lined with velvet (commonly black), with curtains and
tassels, and the seats like couches, to lie stretched on, while he who
rows, stands upright on the very edge of the boat, and, with one oar
bending forward as if he would fall into the sea, rows and turns with
incredible dexterity; thus passing from channel to channel, landing his
fare, or patron, at what house he pleases. The beaks of these vessels are
not unlike the ancient Roman rostrums.

The first public building I went to see was the Rialto, a bridge of one
arch over the grand canal, so large as to admit a galley to row under it,
built of good marble, and having on it, besides many pretty shops, three
ample and stately passages for people without any inconvenience, the two
outmost nobly balustered with the same stone; a piece of architecture
much to be admired. It was evening, and the canal where the Noblesse go
to take the air, as in our Hyde Park, was full of ladies and gentlemen.
There are many times dangerous stops, by reason of the multitude of
gondolas ready to sink one another; and indeed they affect to lean them
on one side, that one who is not accustomed to it, would be afraid of
over-setting. Here they were singing, playing on harpsichords, and other
music, and serenading their mistresses; in another place, racing, and
other pastimes on the water, it being now exceeding hot.

Next day, I went to their Exchange, a place like ours, frequented by
merchants, but nothing so magnificent; from thence, my guide led me to
the Fondigo di Todeschi, which is their magazine, and here many of the
merchants, especially Germans, have their lodging and diet, as in a
college. The outside of this stately fabric is painted by Giorgione da
Castelfranco, and Titian himself.

Hence, I passed through the Mercera, one of the most delicious streets in
the world for the sweetness of it, and is all the way on both sides
tapestried as it were with cloth of gold, rich damasks and other silks,
which the shops expose and hang before their houses from the first floor,
and with that variety that for near half the year spent chiefly in this
city, I hardly remember to have seen the same piece twice exposed; to
this add the perfumes, apothecaries' shops, and the innumerable cages of
nightingales which they keep, that entertain you with their melody from
shop to shop, so that shutting your eyes, you would imagine yourself in
the country, when indeed you are in the middle of the sea. It is almost
as silent as the middle of a field, there being neither rattling of
coaches nor trampling of horses. This street, paved with brick, and
exceedingly clean, brought us through an arch into the famous piazza of
St. Mark.

Over this porch stands that admirable clock, celebrated, next to that of
Strasburg, for its many movements; among which, about twelve and six,
which are their hours of Ave Maria, when all the town are on their knees,
come forth the three Kings led by a star, and passing by the image of
Christ in his Mother's arms, do their reverence, and enter into the clock
by another door. At the top of this turret, another automaton strikes the
quarters. An honest merchant told me that one day walking in the piazza,
he saw the fellow who kept the clock struck with this hammer so forcibly,
as he was stooping his head near the bell, to mend something amiss at the
instant of striking, that being stunned, he reeled over the battlements,
and broke his neck. The buildings in this piazza are all arched, on
pillars, paved within with black and white polished marble, even to the
shops, the rest of the fabric as stately as any in Europe, being not only
marble, but the architecture is of the famous Sansovini, who lies buried
in St. Jacomo, at the end of the piazza. The battlements of this noble
range of buildings, are railed with stone, and thick-set with excellent
statues, which add a great ornament. One of the sides is yet much more
Roman-like than the other which regards the sea, and where the church is
placed. The other range is plainly Gothic; and so we entered into St.
Mark's Church, before which stand two brass pedestals exquisitely cast
and figured, which bear as many tall masts painted red, on which, upon
great festivals, they hang flags and streamers. The church is also
Gothic; yet for the preciousness of the materials, being of several rich
marbles, abundance of porphyry, serpentine, etc., far exceeding any in
Rome, St. Peter's hardly excepted. I much admired the splendid history of
our blessed Savior, composed all of Mosaic over the _facciata_, below
which and over the four chief gates are cast four horses in copper as big
as the life, the same that formerly were transported from Rome by
Constantine to Byzantium, and thence by the Venetians hither.[33] They
are supported by eight porphyry columns, of very great size and value.
Being come into the church, you see nothing, and tread on nothing, but
what is precious. The floor is all inlaid with agates, lazulis,
chalcedons, jaspers, porphyries, and other rich marbles, admirable also
for the work; the walls sumptuously incrusted, and presenting to the
imagination the shapes of men, birds, houses, flowers, and a thousand
varieties. The roof is of most excellent Mosaic; but what most persons
admire is the new work of the emblematic tree at the other passage out of
the church. In the midst of this rich _volto_ rise five cupolas, the
middle very large and sustained by thirty-six marble columns, eight of
which are of precious marbles: under these cupolas is the high altar, on
which is a reliquary of several sorts of jewels, engraven with figures,
after the Greek manner, and set together with plates of pure gold. The
altar is covered with a canopy of ophite, on which is sculptured the
story of the Bible, and so on the pillars, which are of Parian marble,
that support it. Behind these, are four other columns of transparent and
true Oriental alabaster, brought hither out of the mines of Solomon's
Temple, as they report. There are many chapels and notable monuments of
illustrious persons, dukes, cardinals, etc., as Zeno, J. Soranzi, and
others: there is likewise a vast baptistry, of copper. Among other
venerable relics is a stone, on which they say our blessed Lord stood
preaching to those of Tyre and Sidon, and near the door is an image of
Christ, much adorned, esteeming it very sacred, for that a rude fellow
striking it they say, there gushed out a torrent of blood. In one of the
corners lies the body of St. Isidore, brought hither 500 years since from
the island of Chios. A little farther, they show the picture of St.
Dominic and Francis, affirmed to have been made by the Abbot Joachim
(many years before any of them were born). Going out of the church, they
showed us the stone where Alexander III. trod on the neck of the Emperor
Frederick Barbarossa, pronouncing that verse of the psalm, "_super
basiliscum_," etc. The doors of the church are of massy copper. There are
near 500 pillars in this building, most of them porphyry and serpentine,
and brought chiefly from Athens, and other parts of Greece, formerly in
their power. At the corner of the church, are inserted into the main wall
four figures, as big as life, cut in porphyry; which they say are the
images of four brothers who poisoned one another, by which means were
escheated to the Republic that vast treasury of relics now belonging to
the church. At the other entrance that looks toward the sea, stands in a
small chapel that statue of our Lady, made (as they affirm) of the same
stone, or rock, out of which Moses brought water to the murmuring
Israelites at Horeb, or Meriba.

    [Footnote 33: They were taken away by Bonaparte to Paris; but in
    1815, were sent back to Venice.]

After all that is said, this church is, in my opinion, much too dark and
dismal, and of heavy work; the fabric,--as is much of Venice, both for
buildings and other fashions and circumstances,--after the Greeks, their
next neighbors.

The next day, by favor of the French ambassador, I had admittance with
him to view the Reliquary, called here Tesoro di San Marco, which very
few, even of travelers, are admitted to see. It is a large chamber full
of presses. There are twelve breastplates or pieces of pure golden armor,
studded with precious stones, and as many crowns dedicated to St. Mark,
by so many noble Venetians, who had recovered their wives taken at sea by
the Saracens; many curious vases of agates; the cap, or coronet, of the
Dukes of Venice, one of which had a ruby set on it, esteemed worth
200,000 crowns; two unicorns' horns; numerous vases and dishes of agate,
set thick with precious stones and vast pearls; divers heads of Saints
enchased in gold; a small ampulla, or glass, with our Savior's blood; a
great morsel of the real cross; one of the nails; a thorn; a fragment of
the column to which our Lord was bound, when scourged; the standard or
ensign, of Constantine; a piece of St. Luke's arm; a rib of St. Stephen;
a finger of Mary Magdalen; numerous other things, which I could not
remember. But a priest, first vesting himself in his sacerdotals, with
the stole about his neck, showed us the gospel of St. Mark (their tutelar
patron) written by his own hand, and whose body they show buried in the
church, brought hither from Alexandria many years ago.

The Religious de li Servi have fine paintings of Paolo Veronese,
especially the Magdalen.

A French gentleman and myself went to the Courts of Justice, the Senate
House, and Ducal Palace. The first court near this church is almost
wholly built of several colored sorts of marble, like checkerwork on the
outside; this is sustained by vast pillars, not very shapely, but
observable for their capitals, and that out of thirty-three no two are
alike. Under this fabric is the cloister where merchants meet morning and
evening, as also the grave senators and gentlemen, to confer of state
affairs, in their gowns and caps, like so many philosophers; it is a very
noble and solemn spectacle. In another quadrangle, stood two square
columns of white marble, carved, which they said had been erected to hang
one of their Dukes on, who designed to make himself Sovereign. Going
through a stately arch, there were standing in niches divers statues of
great value, among which is the so celebrated Eve, esteemed worth its
weight in gold; it is just opposite to the stairs where are two
Colossuses of Mars and Neptune, by Sansovino. We went up into a Corridor
built with several Tribunals and Courts of Justice; and by a
well-contrived staircase were landed in the Senate hall, which appears to
be one of the most noble and spacious rooms in Europe, being seventy-six
paces long, and thirty-two in breadth. At the upper end, are the
Tribunals of the Doge, Council of Ten, and Assistants: in the body of the
hall, are lower ranks of seats, capable of containing 1,500 Senators; for
they consist of no fewer on grand debates. Over the Duke's throne are the
paintings of the Final Judgment, by Tintoret, esteemed among the best
pieces in Europe. On the roof are the famous Acts of the Republic,
painted by several excellent masters, especially Bassano; next them, are
the effigies of the several Dukes, with their Elogies. Then, we turned
into a great Court painted with the Battle of Lepanto, an excellent
piece; afterward, into the Chamber of the Council of Ten, painted by the
most celebrated masters. From hence, by the special favor of an
Illustrissimo, we were carried to see the private Armory of the Palace,
and so to the same court we first entered, nobly built of polished white
marble, part of which is the Duke's Court, _pro tempore_; there are two
wells adorned with excellent work in copper. This led us to the seaside,
where stand those columns of ophite stone in the entire piece, of a great
height, one bearing St. Mark's Lion, the other St. Theodorus: these
pillars were brought from Greece, and set up by Nicholas Baraterius, the
architect; between them public executions are performed.

Having fed our eyes with the noble prospect of the Island of St. George,
the galleys, gondolas, and other vessels passing to and fro, we walked
under the cloister on the other side of this goodly piazza, being a most
magnificent building, the design of Sansovino. Here we went into the
_Zecca_, or mint; at the entrance, stand two prodigious giants, or
Hercules, of white marble; we saw them melt, beat, and coin silver, gold,
and copper. We then went up into the Procuratory, and a library of
excellent MSS. and books belonging to it and the public. After this, we
climbed up the tower of St. Mark, which we might have done on horseback,
as it is said one of the French Kings did; there being no stairs, or
steps, but returns that take up an entire square on the arches forty
feet, broad enough for a coach. This steeple stands by itself, without
any church near it, and is rather a watch tower in the corner of the
great piazza, 230 feet in height, the foundation exceeding deep; on the
top, is an angel, that turns with the wind; and from hence is a prospect
down the Adriatic, as far as Istria and the Dalmatian side, with the
surprising sight of this miraculous city, lying in the bosom of the sea,
in the shape of a lute, the numberless islands tacked together by no
fewer than 450 bridges. At the foot of this tower, is a public tribunal
of excellent work, in white marble polished, adorned with several brass
statues and figures of stone and mezzo-relievo, the performance of some
rare artist.

It was now Ascension-week, and the great mart, or fair, of the whole year
was kept, everybody at liberty and jolly; the noblemen stalking with
their ladies on _choppines_. These are high-heeled shoes, particularly
affected by these proud dames, or, as some say, invented to keep them at
home, it being very difficult to walk with them; whence, one being asked
how he liked the Venetian dames, replied, they were "_mezzo carne, mezzo
legno_," half flesh, half wood, and he would have none of them. The truth
is, their garb is very odd, as seeming always in masquerade; their other
habits also totally different from all nations. They wear very long,
crisp hair, of several streaks and colors, which they make so by a wash,
disheveling it on the brims of a broad hat that has no crown, but a hole
to put out their heads by; they dry them in the sun, as one may see them
at their windows. In their tire, they set silk flowers and sparkling
stones, their petticoats coming from their very arm-pits, so that they
are near three quarters and a half apron; their sleeves are made
exceedingly wide, under which their shift-sleeves as wide, and commonly
tucked up to the shoulder, showing their naked arms, through false
sleeves of tiffany, girt with a bracelet or two, with knots of point
richly tagged about their shoulders and other places of their body, which
they usually cover with a kind of yellow veil of lawn, very transparent.
Thus attired, they set their hands on the heads of two matron-like
servants, or old women, to support them, who are mumbling their beads. It
is ridiculous to see how these ladies crawl in and out of their gondolas,
by reason of their _choppines_; and what dwarfs they appear, when taken
down from their wooden scaffolds; of these I saw near thirty together,
stalking half as high again as the rest of the world. For courtesans, or
the citizens, may not wear _choppines_, but cover their bodies and faces
with a veil of a certain glittering taffeta, or lustrée, out of which
they now and then dart a glance of their eye, the whole face being
otherwise entirely hid with it: nor may the common misses take this
habit; but go abroad barefaced. To the corner of these virgin-veils hang
broad but flat tassels of curious Point de Venice. The married women go
in black veils. The nobility wear the same color, but a fine cloth lined
with taffeta, in summer, with fur of the bellies of squirrels, in the
winter, which all put on at a certain day, girt with a girdle embossed
with silver, the vest not much different from what our Bachelors of Arts
wear in Oxford, and a hood of cloth, made like a sack, cast over their
left shoulder, and a round cloth black cap fringed with wool, which is
not so comely; they also wear their collar open, to show the diamond
button of the stock of their shirt. I have never seen pearls for color
and bigness comparable to what the ladies wear, most of the noble
families being very rich in jewels, especially pearls, which are always
left to the son, or brother who is destined to marry; which the eldest
seldom do. The Doge's vest is of crimson velvet, the Procurator's, etc.
of damask, very stately. Nor was I less surprised with the strange
variety of the several nations seen every day in the streets and piazzas;
Jews, Turks, Armenians, Persians, Moors, Greeks, Sclavonians, some with
their targets and bucklers, and all in their native fashions, negotiating
in this famous Emporium, which is always crowded with strangers.

This night, having with my Lord Bruce taken our places before we went to
the Opera, where comedies and other plays are represented in recitative
music, by the most excellent musicians, vocal and instrumental, with
variety of scenes painted and contrived with no less art of perspective,
and machines for flying in the air, and other wonderful notions; taken
together, it is one of the most magnificent and expensive diversions the
wit of man can invent. The history was, Hercules in Lydia; the scenes
changed thirteen times. The famous voices, Anna Rencia, a Roman, and
reputed the best treble of women; but there was an eunuch who, in my
opinion, surpassed her; also a Genoese that sung an incomparable bass.
This held us by the eyes and ears till two in the morning, when we went
to the Chetto de san Felice, to see the noblemen and their ladies at
basset, a game at cards which is much used; but they play not in public,
and all that have inclination to it are in masquerade, without speaking
one word, and so they come in, play, lose or gain, and go away as they
please. This time of license is only in carnival and this Ascension-week;
neither are their theatres open for that other magnificence, or for
ordinary comedians, save on these solemnities, they being a frugal and
wise people, and exact observers of all sumptuary laws.

There being at this time a ship bound for the Holy Land, I had resolved
to embark, intending to see Jerusalem, and other parts of Syria, Egypt
and Turkey; but after I had provided all necessaries, laid in snow to
cool our drink, bought some sheep, poultry, biscuit, spirits, and a
little cabinet of drugs in case of sickness, our vessel (whereof Captain
Powell was master), happened to be pressed for the service of the State,
to carry provisions to Candia, now newly attacked by the Turks; which
altogether frustrated my design, to my great mortification.

On the ... of June, we went to Padua, to the fair of their St. Anthony,
in company of divers passengers. The first _terra firma_ we landed at was
Fusina, being only an inn where we changed our barge, and were then drawn
up by horses through the river Brenta, a straight channel as even as a
line for twenty miles, the country on both sides deliciously adorned with
country villas and gentlemen's retirements, gardens planted with oranges,
figs, and other fruit, belonging to the Venetians. At one of these villas
we went ashore to see a pretty contrived palace. Observable in this
passage was buying their water of those who farm the sluices; for this
artificial river is in some places so shallow, that reserves of water are
kept with sluices, which they open and shut with a most ingenious
invention, or engine, governed even by a child. Thus they keep up the
water, or let it go, till the next channel be either filled by the stop,
or abated to the level of the other; for which every boat pays a certain
duty. Thus, we stayed near half an hour and more, at three several
places, so as it was evening before we got to Padua. This is a very
ancient city, if the tradition of Antenor's, being the founder, be not a
fiction; but thus speaks the inscription over a stately gate:

    "_Hanc antiquissimam urbem literarum omnium asylum, cujus agrum
    fertilitatis Lumen Natura esse voluit, Antenor condidit, anno ante
    Christum natum M. Cxviii; Senatus autem Venetus his belli
    propugnaculis ornavit._"

The town stands on the river Padus, whence its name, and is generally
built like Bologna, on arches and on brick, so that one may walk all
around it, dry, and in the shade; which is very convenient in these hot
countries, and I think I was never sensible of so burning a heat as I
was this season, especially the next day, which was that of the fair,
filled with noble Venetians, by reason of a great and solemn procession
to their famous cathedral. Passing by St. Lorenzo, I met with this
subscription:

    "_Inclytus Antenor patriam vox nisa quietem
      Transtulit huc Henetum Dardanidumq; fuga,
    Expulit Euganeos, Patavinam condidit urbem,
      Quem tegit hic humili marmore cæsa domus._"

Under the tomb, was a cobbler at his work. Being now come to St. Antony's
(the street most of the way straight, well built, and outside excellently
painted in _fresco_), we surveyed the spacious piazza, in which is
erected a noble statue of copper of a man on horseback, in memory of one
Catta Malata, a renowned captain. The church, _à la Greca_, consists of
five handsome cupolas, leaded. At the left hand within is the tomb of St.
Antony and his altar, about which a mezzo-relievo of the miracles
ascribed to him is exquisitely wrought in white marble by the three
famous sculptors, Tullius Lombardus, Jacobus Sansovinus, and Hieronymus
Compagno. A little higher is the choir, walled parapet-fashion, with
sundry colored stone, half relievo, the work of Andrea Reccij. The altar
within is of the same metal, which, with the candlestick and bases, is,
in my opinion, as magnificent as any in Italy. The wainscot of the choir
is rarely inlaid and carved. Here are the sepulchres of many famous
persons, as of Rodolphus Fulgosi, etc.; and among the rest, one for an
exploit at sea, has a galley exquisitely carved thereon. The procession
bore the banners with all the treasure of the cloister, which was a very
fine sight.

Hence, walking over the Prato delle Valle, I went to see the convent of
St. Justina, than which I never beheld one more magnificent. The church
is an excellent piece of architecture, of Andrea Palladio, richly paved,
with a stately cupola that covers the high altar enshrining the ashes of
that saint. It is of _pietra-commessa_, consisting of flowers very
naturally done. The choir is inlaid with several sorts of wood
representing the holy history, finished with exceeding industry. At the
far end, is that rare painting of St. Justina's Martyrdom, by Paolo
Veronese; and a stone on which they told us divers primitive Christians
had been decapitated. In another place (to which leads a small cloister
well painted) is a dry well, covered with a brass-work grate, wherein are
the bones of divers martyrs. They show also the bones of St. Luke, in an
old alabaster coffin; three of the Holy Innocents; and the bodies of St.
Maximus and Prosdocimus.[34] The dormitory above is exceedingly
commodious and stately; but what most pleased me, was the old cloister so
well painted with the legendary saints, mingled with many ancient
inscriptions, and pieces of urns dug up, it seems, at the foundation of
the church. Thus, having spent the day in rambles, I returned the next
day to Venice.

    [Footnote 34: St. Peter's disciple, first Bishop of Padua.]

[Sidenote: VENICE]

The arsenal is thought to be one of the best furnished in the world. We
entered by a strong port, always guarded, and, ascending a spacious
gallery, saw arms of back, breast, and head, for many thousands; in
another were saddles; over them, ensigns taken from the Turks. Another
hall is for the meeting of the Senate; passing a graff, are the smiths'
forges, where they are continually employed on anchors and iron work.
Near it is a well of fresh water, which they impute to two rhinoceros's
horns which they say lie in it, and will preserve it from ever being
empoisoned. Then we came to where the carpenters were building their
magazines of oars, masts, etc., for an hundred galleys and ships, which
have all their apparel and furniture near them. Then the foundry, where
they cast ordnance; the forge is 450 paces long, and one of them has
thirteen furnaces. There is one cannon, weighing 16,573 pounds, cast
while Henry the Third dined, and put into a galley built, rigged, and
fitted for launching within that time. They have also arms for twelve
galeasses, which are vessels to row, of almost 150 feet long, and thirty
wide, not counting prow or poop, and contain twenty-eight banks of oars,
each seven men, and to carry 1,300 men, with three masts. In another, a
magazine for fifty galleys, and place for some hundreds more. Here stands
the Bucentaur, with a most ample deck, and so contrived that the slaves
are not seen, having on the poop a throne for the Doge to sit, when he
goes in triumph to espouse the Adriatic. Here is also a gallery of 200
yards long for cables, and above that a magazine of hemp. Opposite these,
are the saltpetre houses, and a large row of cells, or houses, to
protect their galleys from the weather. Over the gate, as we go out, is a
room full of great and small guns, some of which discharge six times at
once. Then, there is a court full of cannon, bullets, chains, grapples,
grenadoes, etc., and over that arms for 800,000 men, and by themselves
arms for 400, taken from some that were in a plot against the state;
together with weapons of offense and defense for sixty-two ships;
thirty-two pieces of ordnance, on carriages taken from the Turks, and one
prodigious mortar-piece. In a word, it is not to be reckoned up what this
large place contains of this sort. There were now twenty-three galleys,
and four galley-grossi, of 100 oars to a side. The whole arsenal is
walled about, and may be in compass about three miles, with twelve towers
for the watch, besides that the sea environs it. The workmen, who are
ordinarily 500, march out in military order, and every evening receive
their pay through a small hole in the gate where the governor lives.

The next day, I saw a wretch executed, who had murdered his master, for
which he had his head chopped off by an ax that slid down a frame of
timber, between the two tall columns in St. Mark's piazza, at the
sea-brink; the executioner striking on the ax with a beetle; and so the
head fell off the block.

Hence, by Gudala, we went to see Grimani's Palace, the portico whereof is
excellent work. Indeed, the world cannot show a city of more stately
buildings, considering the extent of it, all of square stone, and as
chargeable in their foundations as superstructure, being all built on
piles at an immense cost. We returned home by the church of St. Johanne
and Paulo, before which is, in copper, the statue of Bartolomeo Colone,
on horseback, double gilt, on a stately pedestal, the work of Andrea
Verrochio, a Florentine. This is a very fine church, and has in it many
rare altarpieces of the best masters, especially that on the left hand,
of the Two Friars slain, which is of Titian.

The day after, being Sunday, I went over to St. George's to the ceremony
of the schismatic Greeks, who are permitted to have their church, though
they are at defiance with Rome. They allow no carved images, but many
painted, especially the story of their patron and his dragon. Their rites
differ not much from the Latins, save that of communicating in both
species, and distribution of the holy bread. We afterward fell into a
dispute with a Candiot, concerning the procession of the Holy Ghost. The
church is a noble fabric.

The church of St. Zachary is a Greek building, by Leo IV., Emperor, and
has in it the bones of that prophet, with divers other saints. Near this,
we visited St. Luke's, famous for the tomb of Aretin.

Tuesday, we visited several other churches, as Santa Maria, newly
incrusted with marble on the outside, and adorned with porphyry, ophite,
and Spartan stone. Near the altar and under the organ, are sculptures,
that are said to be of the famous artist Praxiteles. To that of St. Paul
I went purposely, to see the tomb of Titian. Then to St. John the
Evangelist, where among other heroes, lies Andrea Baldarius, the inventor
of oars applied to great vessels for fighting.

We also saw St. Roche, the roof whereof is, with the school, or hall, of
that rich confraternity, admirably painted by Tintoretto, especially the
Crucifix in the _sacristia_. We saw also the church of St. Sebastian, and
Carmelites' monastery.

Next day, taking our gondola at St. Mark's, I passed to the island of St.
George Maggiore, where is a Convent of Benedictines, and a well-built
church of Andrea Palladio, the great architect. The pavement, cupola,
choir, and pictures, very rich and sumptuous. The cloister has a fine
garden to it, which is a rare thing at Venice, though this is an island a
little distant from the city; it has also an olive orchard, all environed
by the sea. The new cloister now building has a noble staircase paved
with white and black marble.

From hence, we visited St. Spirito, and St. Laurence, fair churches in
several islands; but most remarkable is that of the Padri Olivetani, in
St. Helen's island, for the rare paintings and carvings, with inlaid
work, etc.

[Sidenote: PADUA]

The next morning, we went again to Padua, where, on the following day, we
visited the market, which is plentifully furnished, and exceedingly
cheap. Here we saw the great hall, built in a spacious piazza, and one of
the most magnificent in Europe; its ascent is by steps a good height, of
a reddish marble polished, much used in these parts, and happily found
not far off; it is almost 200 paces long, and forty in breadth, all
covered with lead, without any support of columns. At the further end
stands the bust, in white marble, of Titus Livius, the historian. In this
town is the house wherein he was born, full of inscriptions, and pretty
fair.

Near to the monument of Speron Speroni, is painted on the ceiling the
celestial zodiac, and other astronomical figures; without side, there is
a corridor, in manner of a balcony, of the same stone; and at the entry
of each of the three gates is the head of some famous person, as Albert
Eremitano, Julio Paullo (lawyers), and Peter Aponius. In the piazza is
the Podesta's and Capitano Grande's Palace, well built; but above all,
the Monte Pietà, the front whereof is of most excellent architecture.
This is a foundation of which there is one in most of the cities in
Italy, where there is a continual bank of money to assist the poorer
sort, on any pawn, and at reasonable interest, together with magazines
for deposit of goods, till redeemed.

Hence, to the Schools of this flourishing and ancient University,
especially for the study of physic and anatomy. They are fairly built in
quadrangle, with cloisters beneath, and above with columns. Over the
great gate are the arms of the Venetian State, and under the lion of St.
Mark.

    _Sic ingredere, ut teipso quotidie doctior; sic egredere ut indies
    Patriæ Christianæq; Republicæ utilior evadas; ita demùm Gymnasium à
    te felicitèr se ornatum existimabit._

                              CIC.IX.

About the court walls, are carved in stone and painted the blazons of the
Consuls of all the nations, that from time to time have had that charge
and honor in the University, which at my being there was my worthy friend
Dr. Rogers, who here took that degree.

The Schools for the lectures of the several sciences are above, but none
of them comparable, or so much frequented, as the theater for anatomy,
which is excellently contrived both for the dissector and spectators. I
was this day invited to dinner, and in the afternoon (30th July) received
my _matricula_, being resolved to spend some months here at study,
especially physic and anatomy, of both which there were now the most
famous professors in Europe. My _matricula_ contained a clause, that I,
my goods, servants, and messengers, should be free from all tolls and
reprises, and that we might come, pass, return, buy, or sell, without any
toll, etc.

The next morning, I saw the garden of simples, rarely furnished with
plants, and gave order to the gardener to make me a collection of them
for an _hortus hyemalis_, by permission of the Cavalier Dr. Veslingius,
then Prefect and Botanic Professor as well as of Anatomy.

This morning, the Earl of Arundel,[35] now in this city, a famous
collector of paintings and antiquities, invited me to go with him to see
the garden of Mantua, where, as one enters, stands a huge _colosse_ of
Hercules. From hence to a place where was a room covered with a noble
cupola, built purposely for music; the fillings up, or cove, between the
walls, were of urns and earthen pots, for the better sounding; it was
also well painted. After dinner, we walked to the Palace of Foscari all'
Arena, there remaining yet some appearances of an ancient theater, though
serving now for a court only before the house. There were now kept in it
two eagles, a crane, a Mauritanian sheep, a stag, and sundry fowls, as in
a vivary.

    [Footnote 35: The celebrated Thomas, Earl of Arundel, part of whose
    collection was eventually procured for the University of Oxford by
    Evelyn, and is distinguished by the name _Marmora Arundeliana_.]

[Sidenote: VENICE]

Three days after, I returned to Venice, and passed over to Murano, famous
for the best glasses in the world, where having viewed their furnaces,
and seen their work, I made a collection of divers curiosities and
glasses, which I sent for England by long sea. It is the white flints
they have from Pavia, which they pound and sift exceedingly small, and
mix with ashes made of a seaweed brought out of Syria, and a white sand,
that causes this manufacture to excel. The town is a Podestaria by
itself, at some miles distant on the sea from Venice, and like it, built
on several small islands. In this place, are excellent oysters, small and
well tasted like our Colchester, and they were the first, as I remember,
that I ever could eat; for I had naturally an aversion to them.

At our return to Venice, we met several gondolas full of Venetian ladies,
who come thus far in fine weather to take the air, with music and other
refreshments. Besides that, Murano is itself a very nobly built town, and
has divers noblemen's palaces in it, and handsome gardens.

In coming back, we saw the islands of St. Christopher and St. Michael,
the last of which has a church enriched and incrusted with marbles and
other architectonic ornaments, which the monks very courteously showed
us. It was built and founded by Margaret Emiliana of Verona, a famous
courtesan, who purchased a great estate, and by this foundation hoped to
commute for her sins. We then rowed by the isles of St. Nicholas, whose
church, with the monuments of the Justinian family, entertained us
awhile; and then got home.

The next morning, Captain Powell, in whose ship I was to embark toward
Turkey, invited me on board, lying about ten miles from Venice, where we
had a dinner of English powdered beef and other good meat, with store of
wine and great guns, as the manner is. After dinner, the Captain
presented me with a stone he had lately brought from Grand Cairo, which
he took from the mummy-pits, full of hieroglyphics; I drew it on paper
with the true dimensions, and sent it in a letter to Mr. Henshaw to
communicate to Father Kircher, who was then setting forth his great work
"Obeliscus Pamphilius," where it is described, but without mentioning my
name. The stone was afterward brought for me into England, and landed at
Wapping, where, before I could hear of it, it was broken into several
fragments, and utterly defaced, to my no small disappointment.

The boatswain of the ship also gave me a hand and foot of a mummy, the
nails whereof had been overlaid with thin plates of gold, and the whole
body was perfect, when he brought it out of Egypt; but the avarice of the
ship's crew broke it to pieces, and divided the body among them. He
presented me also with two Egyptian idols, and some loaves of the bread
which the Coptics use in the Holy Sacrament, with other curiosities.

8th August, 1645. I had news from Padua of my election to be _Syndicus
Artistarum_, which caused me, after two days idling in a country villa
with the Consul of Venice, to hasten thither, that I might discharge
myself of that honor, because it was not only chargeable, but would have
hindered my progress, and they chose a Dutch gentleman in my place,
which did not well please my countrymen, who had labored not a little to
do me the greatest honor a stranger is capable of in that University.
Being freed from this impediment, and having taken leave of Dr. Janicius,
a Polonian, who was going as physician in the Venetian galleys to Candia,
I went again to Venice, and made a collection of several books and some
toys. Three days after, I returned to Padua, where I studied hard till
the arrival of Mr. Henshaw, Bramstone, and some other English gentlemen
whom I had left at Rome, and who made me go back to Venice, where I spent
some time in showing them what I had seen there.

26th September, 1645. My dear friend, and till now my constant
fellow-traveler, Mr. Thicknesse, being obliged to return to England upon
his particular concern, and who had served his Majesty in the wars, I
accompanied him part of his way, and, on the 28th, returned to Venice.

29th September, 1645. Michaelmas day, I went with my Lord Mowbray (eldest
son to the Earl of Arundel, and a most worthy person) to see the
collection of a noble Venetian, Signor Rugini. He has a stately palace,
richly furnished with statues and heads of Roman Emperors, all placed in
an ample room. In the next, was a cabinet of medals, both Latin and
Greek, with divers curious shells and two fair pearls in two of them;
but, above all, he abounded in things petrified, walnuts, eggs in which
the yoke rattled, a pear, a piece of beef with the bones in it, a whole
hedgehog, a plaice on a wooden trencher turned into stone and very
perfect, charcoal, a morsel of cork yet retaining its levity, sponges,
and a piece of taffety part rolled up, with innumerable more. In another
cabinet, supported by twelve pillars of oriental agate, and railed about
with crystal, he showed us several noble intáglios of agate, especially a
head of Tiberius, a woman in a bath with her dog, some rare cornelians,
onyxes, crystals, etc., in one of which was a drop of water not
congealed, but moving up and down, when shaken; above all, a diamond
which had a very fair ruby growing in it; divers pieces of amber, wherein
were several insects, in particular one cut like a heart that contained
in it a salamander without the least defect, and many pieces of mosaic.
The fabric of this cabinet was very ingenious, set thick with agates,
turquoises, and other precious stones, in the midst of which was an
antique of a dog in stone scratching his ear, very rarely cut, and
comparable to the greatest curiosity I had ever seen of that kind for the
accurateness of the work. The next chamber had a bedstead all inlaid with
agates, crystals, cornelians, lazuli, etc., esteemed worth 16,000 crowns,
but, for the most part, the bedsteads in Italy are of forged iron gilded,
since it is impossible to keep the wooden ones from the cimices.

[Sidenote: PADUA]

From hence, I returned to Padua, when that town was so infested with
soldiers, that many houses were broken open in the night, some murders
committed, and the nuns next our lodging disturbed, so as we were forced
to be on our guard with pistols and other firearms to defend our doors;
and indeed the students themselves take a barbarous liberty in the
evenings when they go to their strumpets, to stop all that pass by the
house where any of their companions in folly are with them. This custom
they call _chi vali_, so as the streets are very dangerous, when the
evenings grow dark; nor is it easy to reform this intolerable usage,
where there are so many strangers of several nations.

Using to drink my wine cooled with snow and ice, as the manner here is, I
was so afflicted with an angina and sore throat, that it had almost cost
me my life. After all the remedies Cavalier Veslingius, chief professor
here, could apply, old Salvatico (that famous physician) being called,
made me be cupped, and scarified in the back in four places; which began
to give me breath, and consequently life; for I was in the utmost danger;
but, God being merciful to me, I was after a fortnight abroad again,
when, changing my lodging, I went over against Pozzo Pinto; where I
bought for winter provision 3,000 weight of excellent grapes, and pressed
my own wine, which proved incomparable liquor.

This was on 10th of October. Soon after came to visit me from Venice Mr.
Henry Howard, grandchild to the Earl of Arundel, Mr. Bramstone, son to
the Lord Chief Justice, and Mr. Henshaw, with whom I went to another part
of the city to lodge near St. Catherine's over against the monastery of
nuns, where we hired the whole house, and lived very nobly. Here I
learned to play on the theorb, taught by Signor Dominico Bassano, who
had a daughter married to a doctor of laws, that played and sung to nine
several instruments, with that skill and address as few masters in Italy
exceeded her; she likewise composed divers excellent pieces: I had never
seen any play on the Naples viol before. She presented me afterward with
two recitativos of hers, both words and music.

31st October, 1645. Being my birthday, the nuns of St. Catherine's sent
me flowers of silkwork. We were very studious all this winter till
Christmas, when on Twelfth-day, we invited all the English and Scots in
town to a feast, which sunk our excellent wine considerably.

[Sidenote: VENICE]

1645-46. In January, Signor Molino was chosen Doge of Venice, but the
extreme snow that fell, and the cold, hindered my going to see the
solemnity, so as I stirred not from Padua till Shrovetide, when all the
world repair to Venice, to see the folly and madness of the Carnival; the
women, men, and persons of all conditions disguising themselves in
antique dresses, with extravagant music and a thousand gambols,
traversing the streets from house to house, all places being then
accessible and free to enter. Abroad, they fling eggs filled with sweet
water, but sometimes not over-sweet. They also have a barbarous custom of
hunting bulls about the streets and piazzas, which is very dangerous, the
passages being generally narrow. The youth of the several wards and
parishes contend in other masteries and pastimes, so that it is
impossible to recount the universal madness of this place during this
time of license. The great banks are set up for those who will play at
bassett; the comedians have liberty, and the operas are open; witty
pasquils are thrown about, and the mountebanks have their stages at every
corner. The diversions which chiefly took me up was three noble operas,
where were excellent voices and music, the most celebrated of which was
the famous Anna Rencia, whom we invited to a fish dinner after four days
in Lent, when they had given over at the theater. Accompanied with an
eunuch whom she brought with her, she entertained us with rare music,
both of them singing to a harpsichord. It growing late, a gentleman of
Venice came for her, to show her the galleys, now ready to sail for
Candia. This entertainment produced a second, given us by the English
consul of the merchants, inviting us to his house, where he had the
Genoese, the most celebrated bass in Italy, who was one of the late opera
band. This diversion held us so late at night, that, conveying a
gentlewoman who had supped with us to her gondola at the usual place of
landing, we were shot at by two carbines from another gondola, in which
were a noble Venetian and his courtesan unwilling to be disturbed, which
made us run in and fetch other weapons, not knowing what the matter was,
till we were informed of the danger we might incur by pursuing it
farther.

Three days after this, I took my leave of Venice, and went to Padua, to
be present at the famous anatomy lecture, celebrated here with
extraordinary apparatus, lasting almost a whole month. During this time,
I saw a woman, a child, and a man dissected with all the manual
operations of the chirurgeon on the human body. The one was performed by
Cavalier Veslingius and Dr. Jo. Athelsteninus Leonoenas, of whom I
purchased those rare tables of veins and nerves, and caused him to
prepare a third of the lungs, liver, and nervi _sexti par_: with the
gastric veins, which I sent into England, and afterward presented to the
Royal Society, being the first of that kind that had been seen there,
and, for aught I know, in the world, though afterward there were others.
When the anatomy lectures, which were in the mornings, were ended, I went
to see cures done in the hospitals; and certainly as there are the
greatest helps and the most skillful physicians, so there are the most
miserable and deplorable objects to exercise upon. Nor is there any, I
should think, so powerful an argument against the vice reigning in this
licentious country, as to be spectator of the misery these poor creatures
undergo. They are indeed very carefully attended, and with extraordinary
charity.

20th March, 1646. I returned to Venice, where I took leave of my friends.

22d March, 1646. I was invited to excellent English potted venison, at
Mr. Hobbson's, a worthy merchant.

23d March, 1646. I took my leave of the Patriarch and the Prince of
Wirtemberg, and Monsieur Grotius (son of the learned Hugo) now going as
commander to Candia; and, in the afternoon, received of Vandervoort, my
merchant, my bills of exchange of 300 ducats for my journey. He showed me
his rare collection of Italian books, esteemed very curious, and of good
value.

The next day, I was conducted to the Ghetto, where the Jews dwell
together in as a tribe or ward, where I was present at a marriage. The
bride was clad in white, sitting in a lofty chair, and covered with a
white veil; then two old Rabbis joined them together, one of them holding
a glass of wine in his hand, which, in the midst of the ceremony,
pretending to deliver to the woman, he let fall, the breaking whereof was
to signify the frailty of our nature, and that we must expect disasters
and crosses amid all enjoyments. This done we had a fine banquet, and
were brought into the bride-chamber, where the bed was dressed up with
flowers, and the counterpane strewn in works. At this ceremony, we saw
divers very beautiful Portuguese Jewesses, with whom we had some
conversation.

I went to the Spanish Ambassador with Bonifacio, his confessor, and
obtained his pass to serve me in the Spanish dominions; without which I
was not to travel, in this pompous form:

    "_Don Caspar de Teves y Guzman, Marques de la Fuente, Señor Le

    _Mar. de la Fuentes, etc._"

Having packed up my purchases of books, pictures, casts, treacle, etc.
(the making an extraordinary ceremony whereof I had been curious to
observe, for it is extremely pompous and worth seeing), I departed from
Venice, accompanied with Mr. Waller (the celebrated poet), now newly
gotten out of England, after the Parliament had extremely worried him for
attempting to put in execution the commission of Array, and for which the
rest of his colleagues were hanged by the rebels.

The next day, I took leave of my comrades at Padua, and receiving some
directions from Dr. Salvatico as to the care of my health, I prepared for
my journey toward Milan.

It was Easter-Monday that I was invited to breakfast at the Earl of
Arundel's. I took my leave of him in his bed, where I left that great and
excellent man in tears on some private discourse of crosses that had
befallen his illustrious family, particularly the undutifulness of his
grandson Philip turning Dominican Friar (since Cardinal of Norfolk), and
the misery of his country now embroiled in civil war. He caused his
gentleman to give me directions, all written with his own hand, what
curiosities I should inquire after in my journey; and, so enjoining me to
write sometimes to him, I departed. There stayed for me below, Mr. Henry
Howard (afterward Duke of Norfolk), Mr. J. Digby, son of Sir Kenelm
Digby, and other gentlemen, who conducted me to the coach.

The famous lapidaries of Venice for false stones and pastes, so as to
emulate the best diamonds, rubies, etc., were Marco Terrasso and Gilbert.

    An account of what Bills of Exchange I took up at Venice since my
    coming from Rome, till my departure from Padua:

        11th Aug., 1645      200
        7th Sept.            135
        1st Oct.             100
        15th Jan., 1646      100
        23d April            300
                             ---
                             835 Ducati di Banco.

In company, then, with Mr. Waller, one Captain Wray (son of Sir
Christopher, whose father had been in arms against his Majesty, and
therefore by no means welcome to us), with Mr. Abdy, a modest and learned
man, we got that night to Vicenza, passing by the Euganéan hills,
celebrated for the prospects and furniture of rare simples, which we
found growing about them. The ways were something deep, the whole country
flat and even as a bowling-green. The common fields lie square, and are
orderly planted with fruit trees, which the vines run and embrace, for
many miles, with delicious streams creeping along the ranges.

Vicenza is a city in the Marquisate of Treviso, yet appertaining to the
Venetians, full of gentlemen and splendid palaces, to which the famous
Palladio, born here, has exceedingly contributed, having been the
architect. Most conspicuous is the Hall of Justice; it has a tower of
excellent work; the lower pillars are of the first order; those in the
three upper corridors are Doric; under them, are shops in a spacious
piazza. The hall was built in imitation of that at Padua, but of a nobler
design, _à la moderne_. The next morning, we visited the theater, as
being of that kind the most perfect now standing, and built by Palladio,
in exact imitation of the ancient Romans, and capable of containing 5,000
spectators. The scene, which is all of stone, represents an imperial
city, the order Corinthian, decorated with statues. Over the Scenario is
inscribed: "_Virtuti ac Genio Olympior: Academia Theatrum hoc à
fundamentis erexit Palladio Architect: 1584_." The scene declines eleven
feet, the _soffito_ painted with clouds. To this there joins a spacious
hall for solemn days to ballot in, and a second for the Academics. In the
piazza is also the _podesta_, or governor's house, the _facciata_ being
of the Corinthian order, very noble. The piazza itself is so large as to
be capable of jousts and tournaments, the nobility of this city being
exceedingly addicted to this knight-errantry, and other martial
diversions. In this place are two pillars in imitation of those at St.
Mark's at Venice, bearing one of them a winged lion, the other the statue
of St. John the Baptist.

In a word, this sweet town has more well-built palaces than any of its
dimensions in all Italy, besides a number begun and not yet finished (but
of stately design) by reason of the domestic dissensions between them and
those of Brescia, fomented by the sage Venetians, lest by combining, they
might think of recovering their ancient liberty. For this reason, also,
are permitted those disorders and insolences committed at Padua among the
youth of these two territories. It is no dishonor in this country to be
some generations in finishing their palaces, that without exhausting
themselves by a vast expense at once, they may at last erect a sumptuous
pile. Count Oleine's Palace is near perfected in this manner. Count
Ulmarini is more famous for his gardens, being without the walls,
especially his _cedrario_, or conserve of oranges, eleven score of my
paces long, set in order and ranges, making a canopy all the way by their
intermixing branches for more than 200 of my single paces, and which
being full of fruit and blossoms, was a most delicious sight. In the
middle of this garden, was a cupola made of wire, supported by slender
pillars of brick, so closely covered with ivy, both without and within,
that nothing was to be perceived but green; between the arches there
dangled festoons of the same. Here is likewise a most inextricable
labyrinth.

I had in this town recommendation to a very civil and ingenious
apothecary, called Angelico, who had a pretty collection of paintings. I
would fain have visited a palace, called the Rotunda, which was a mile
out of town, belonging to Count Martio Capra; but one of our companions
hastening to be gone, and little minding anything save drinking and
folly, caused us to take coach sooner than we should have done.

A little from the town, we passed the Campo Martio, set out in imitation
of ancient Rome, wherein the nobles exercised their horses, and the
ladies make the Corso; it is entered by a stately triumphal arch, the
invention of Palladio.

[Sidenote: VERONA]

Being now set out for Verona, about midway we dined at Ostaria Nova, and
came late to our resting-place, which was the Cavaletto, just over the
monument of the Scalageri,[36] formerly princes of Verona, adorned with
many devices in stone of ladders, alluding to the name.

    [Footnote 36: Or della Scala.]

Early next morning, we went about the city, which is built on the gentle
declivity, and bottom of a hill, environed in part with some considerable
mountains and downs of fine grass, like some places in the south of
England, and, on the other side, having the rich plain where Caius Marius
overthrew the Cimbrians. The city is divided in the midst by the river
Adige, over which are divers stately bridges, and on its banks are many
goodly palaces, whereof one is well painted in _chiaro-oscuro_ on the
outside, as are divers in this dry climate of Italy.

The first thing that engaged our attention and wonder, too, was the
amphitheater, which is the most entire of ancient remains now extant. The
inhabitants call it the ARENA: it has two porticos, one within the other,
and is thirty-four rods long, twenty-two in breadth, with forty-two ranks
of stone benches, or seats, which reach to the top. The vastness of the
marble stones is stupendous. "_L. V. Flaminius, Consul. anno. urb. con.
liii._" This I esteem to be one of the noblest antiquities in Europe, it
is so vast and entire, having escaped the ruins of so many other public
buildings for above 1,400 years.

There are other arches, as that of the victory of Marius; temples,
aqueducts, etc., showing still considerable remains in several places of
the town, and how magnificent it has formerly been. It has three strong
castles and a large and noble wall. Indeed, the whole city is bravely
built, especially the Senate house, where we saw those celebrated statues
of Cornelius Nepos, Æmilius Marcus, Plinius, and Vitruvius, all having
honored Verona by their birth; and, of later date, Julius Cæsar Scaliger,
that prodigy of learning.

In the evening we saw the garden of Count Giusti's villa where are walks
cut out of the main rock, from whence we had a pleasant prospect of
Mantua and Parma, though at great distance. At the entrance of this
garden, grows the goodliest cypress, I fancy, in Europe, cut in a
pyramid; it is a prodigious tree both for breadth and height, entirely
covered, and thick to the base.

Dr. Cortone, a civilian, showed us, among other rarities, a St. Dorothea,
of Raphael. We could not see the rare drawings, especially of Parmensis,
belonging to Dr. Marcello, another advocate, on account of his absence.

Verona deserved all those elogies Scaliger has honored it with; for in my
opinion, the situation is the most delightful I ever saw, it is so
sweetly mixed with rising ground and valleys, so elegantly planted with
trees on which Bacchus seems riding as it were in triumph every autumn,
for the vines reach from tree to tree; here, of all places I have seen in
Italy, would I fix a residence. Well has that learned man given it the
name of the very eye of the world:

    "_Oscelle mundi, Sidus Itali coeli,
    Flos Urbium, flos cornicuumq' amoenum,
    Quot sunt, eruntve, quot fuere, Verona._"

The next morning we traveled over the downs where Marius fought and
fancied ourselves about Winchester, and the country toward Dorsetshire.
We dined at an inn called Cavalli Caschieri, near Peschiera, a very
strong fort of the Venetian Republic, and near the Lago di Garda, which
disembogues into that of Mantua, near forty miles in length, highly
spoken of by my Lord Arundel to me, as the most pleasant spot in Italy,
for which reason I observed it with the more diligence, alighting out of
the coach, and going up to a grove of cypresses growing about a
gentleman's country-house, from whence indeed it presents a most
surprising prospect. The hills and gentle risings about it produce
oranges, citrons, olives, figs, and other tempting fruits, and the waters
abound in excellent fish, especially trouts. In the middle of this lake
stands Sermonea, on an island; here Captain Wray bought a pretty nag of
the master of our inn where we dined, for eight pistoles, which his wife,
our hostess, was so unwilling to part with, that she did nothing but kiss
and weep and hang about the horse's neck, till the captain rode away.

[Sidenote: BRESCIA]

We came this evening to Brescia, which next morning we traversed,
according to our custom, in search of antiquities and new sights. Here, I
purchased of old Lazarino Cominazzo my fine carbine, which cost me nine
pistoles, this city being famous for these firearms, and that workman,
Jo. Bap. Franco, the best esteemed. The city consists most in artists,
every shop abounding in guns, swords, armorers, etc. Most of the workmen
come out of Germany. It stands in a fertile plain, yet the castle is
built on a hill. The streets abound in fair fountains. The Torre della
Pallada is of a noble Tuscan order, and the Senate house is inferior to
few. The piazza is but indifferent; some of the houses arched as at
Padua. The Cathedral was under repair. We would from hence have visited
Parma, Piacenza, Mantua, etc.; but the banditti and other dangerous
parties being abroad, committing many enormities, we were contented with
a Pisgah sight of them.

We dined next day, at Ursa Vecchia, and, after dinner, passed by an
exceeding strong fort of the Venetians, called Ursa Nova, on their
frontier. Then by the river Oglio, and so by Sonano, where we enter the
Spanish dominions, and that night arrived at Crema, which belongs to
Venice, and is well defended. The Podesta's Palace is finely built, and
so is the Duomo, or Cathedral, and the tower to it, with an ample piazza.

[Sidenote: MILAN]

Early next day, after four miles' riding, we entered into the State of
Milan, and passed by Lodi, a great city famous for cheese, little short
of the best Parmeggiano. We dined at Marignano, ten miles before coming
to Milan, where we met half a dozen suspicious cavaliers, who yet did us
no harm. Then, passing as through a continual garden, we went on with
exceeding pleasure; for it is the Paradise of Lombardy, the highways as
even and straight as a line, the fields to a vast extent planted with
fruit about the inclosures, vines to every tree at equal distances, and
watered with frequent streams. There was likewise much corn, and olives
in abundance. At approach of the city, some of our company, in dread of
the Inquisition (severer here than in all Spain), thought of throwing
away some Protestant books and papers. We arrived about three in the
afternoon, when the officers searched us thoroughly for prohibited goods;
but, finding we were only gentlemen travelers, dismissed us for a small
reward, and we went quietly to our inn, the THREE KINGS, where, for that
day, we refreshed ourselves, as we had need. The next morning, we
delivered our letters of recommendation to the learned and courteous
Ferrarius, a Doctor of the Ambrosian College, who conducted us to all the
remarkable places of the town, the first of which was the famous
Cathedral. We entered by a portico, so little inferior to that of Rome
that, when it is finished, it will be hard to say which is the fairest;
the materials are all of white and black marble, with columns of great
height, of Egyptian granite. The outside of the church is so full of
sculpture, that you may number 4,000 statues, all of white marble, among
which that of St. Bartholomew is esteemed a masterpiece. The church is
very spacious, almost as long as St. Peter's at Rome, but not so large.
About the choir, the sacred Story is finely sculptured, in snow-white
marble, nor know I where it is exceeded. About the body of the church
are the miracles of St. Charles Borromeo, and in the vault beneath is his
body before the high altar, grated, and inclosed, in one of the largest
crystals in Europe. To this also belongs a rich treasure. The cupola is
all of marble within and without, and even covered with great planks of
marble, in the Gothic design. The windows are most beautifully painted.
Here are two very fair and excellent organs. The fabric is erected in the
midst of a fair piazza, and in the center of the city.

Hence, we went to the Palace of the Archbishop, which is a quadrangle,
the architecture of Theobaldi, who designed much for Philip II. in the
Escurial, and has built much in Milan. Hence, into the Governor's Palace,
who was Constable of Castile. Tempted by the glorious tapestries and
pictures, I adventured so far alone, that peeping into a chamber where
the great man was under the barber's hands, he sent one of his negroes (a
slave) to know what I was. I made the best excuse I could, and that I was
only admiring the pictures, which he returning and telling his lord, I
heard the Governor reply that I was a spy; on which I retired with all
the speed I could, passed the guard of Swiss, got into the street, and in
a moment to my company, who were gone to the Jesuits' Church, which in
truth is a noble structure, the front especially, after the modern. After
dinner, we were conducted to St. Celso, a church of rare architecture,
built by Bramante; the carvings of the marble _facciata_ are by Annibal
Fontana, whom they esteem at Milan equal to the best of the ancients. In
a room joining to the church, is a marble Madonna, like a Colosse, of the
same sculptor's work, which they will not expose to the air. There are
two _sacristias_, in one of which is a fine Virgin, of Leonardo da Vinci;
in the other is one of Raphael d'Urbino, a piece which all the world
admires. The Sacristan showed us a world of rich plate, jewels, and
embroidered copes, which are kept in presses.

Next, we went to see the Great Hospital, a quadrangular cloister of a
vast compass, a truly royal fabric, with an annual endowment of 50,000
crowns of gold. There is in the middle of it a cross building for the
sick, and, just under it, an altar so placed as to be seen in all places
of the Infirmary.

There are divers colleges built in this quarter, richly provided for by
the same Borromeo and his nephew, the last Cardinal Frederico, some not
yet finished, but of excellent design.

In St. Eustorgio, they tell us, formerly lay the bodies of the three
Magi, since translated to Cologne in Germany; they, however, preserve the
tomb, which is a square stone, on which is engraven a star, and, under
it, "_Sepulchrum trium Magorum_."

Passing by St. Laurence, we saw sixteen columns of marble, and the ruins
of a Temple of Hercules, with this inscription yet standing:

    "_Imp. Cæsari L. Aurelio Vero Aug. Arminiaco Medio Parthico Maxi
    Tribi Pot. VII. Impi IIII. Cos. III. P. P. Divi Antonini Pij Divi
    Hadriani Nepoti Divi Trajani Parthici Pro-Nepoti Divi Nervæ
    Abnepoti Dec. Dec._"

We concluded this day's wandering at the Monastery of Madonna delle
Grazie, and in the refectory admired that celebrated _Coena Domini_ of
Leonardo da Vinci, which takes up the entire wall at the end, and is the
same that the great virtuoso, Francis I., of France, was so enamored of,
that he consulted to remove the whole wall by binding it about with ribs
of iron and timber, to convey it into France. It is indeed one of the
rarest paintings that was ever executed by Leonardo, who was long in the
service of that Prince, and so dear to him that the King, coming to visit
him in his old age and sickness, he expired in his arms. But this
incomparable piece is now exceedingly impaired.

Early next morning came the learned Dr. Ferrarius to visit us, and took
us in his coach to see the Ambrosian Library, where Cardinal Fred
Borromeo has expended so vast a sum on this building, and in furnishing
with curiosities, especially paintings and drawings of inestimable value
among painters. It is a school fit to make the ablest artists. There are
many rare things of Hans Breugel, and among them the Four Elements. In
this room, stands the glorious [boasting] inscription of Cavaliero
Galeazzo Arconati, valuing his gift to the library of several drawings by
Da Vinci; but these we could not see, the keeper of them being out of
town, and he always carrying the keys with him; but my Lord Marshal, who
had seen them, told me all but one book are small that a huge folio
contained 400 leaves full of scratches of Indians, etc. But whereas the
inscription pretends that our King Charles had offered £1,000 for
them,--the truth is, and my Lord himself told me, that it was he who
treated with Galeazzo for himself, in the name and by permission of the
King, and that the Duke of Feria, who was then Governor, should make the
bargain; but my Lord, having seen them since, did not think them of so
much worth.

In the great room, where is a goodly library, on the right hand of the
door, is a small wainscot closet, furnished with rare manuscripts. Two
original letters of the Grand Signor were shown us, sent to two Popes,
one of which was (as I remember) to Alexander VI. [Borgia], and the other
mentioning the head of the lance which pierced our Blessed Savior's side,
as a present to the Pope: I would feign have gotten a copy of them, but
could not; I hear, however, that they are since translated into Italian,
and that therein is a most honorable mention of Christ.

We revisited St. Ambrose's church. The high altar is supported by four
porphyry columns, and under it lie the remains of that holy man. Near it
they showed us a pit, or well (an obscure place it is), where they say
St. Ambrose baptized St. Augustine, and recited the _Te Deum_; for so
imports the inscription. The place is also famous for some Councils that
have been held here, and for the coronation of divers Italian Kings and
Emperors, receiving the iron crown from the Archbishop of this see.[37]
They show the History by Josephus, written on the bark of trees. The high
altar is wonderfully rich.

    [Footnote 37: Bonaparte afterward took it, and placed it on his own
    head.]

Milan is one of the most princely cities in Europe: it has no suburbs,
but is circled with a stately wall for ten miles, in the center of a
country that seems to flow with milk and honey. The air is excellent; the
fields fruitful to admiration, the market abounding with all sorts of
provisions. In the city are near 100 churches, 71 monasteries, and 40,000
inhabitants; it is of a circular figure, fortified with bastions, full of
sumptuous palaces and rare artists, especially for works in crystal,
which is here cheap, being found among the Alps. They have curious
straw-work among the nuns, even to admiration. It has a good river, and a
citadel at some small distance from the city, commanding it, of great
strength for its works and munitions of all kinds. It was built by
Galeatius II., and consists of four bastions, and works at the angles and
fronts; the graff is faced with brick to a very great depth; has two
strong towers as one enters, and within is another fort, and spacious
lodgings for the soldiers, and for exercising them. No accommodation for
strength is wanting, and all exactly uniform. They have here also all
sorts of work and tradesmen, a great magazine of arms and provisions. The
fosse is of spring water, with a mill for grinding corn, and the ramparts
vaulted underneath. Don Juan Vasques Coronada was now Governor; the
garrison Spaniards only.

There is nothing better worth seeing than the collection of Signor
Septalla, a canon of St. Ambrose, famous over Christendom for his
learning and virtues. Among other things, he showed us an Indian wood,
that has the perfect scent of civet; a flint, or pebble, that has a
quantity of water in it, which is plainly to be seen, it being clear as
agate; divers crystals that have water moving in them, some of them
having plants, leaves, and hog's bristles in them; much amber full of
insects, and divers things of woven amianthus.

Milan is a sweet place, and though the streets are narrow, they abound in
rich coaches, and are full of noblesse, who frequent the course every
night. Walking a turn in the portico before the dome, a cavaliero who
passed by, hearing some of us speaking English, looked a good while
earnestly on us, and by and by sending his servant, desiring we would
honor him the next day at dinner. We looked on this as an odd invitation,
he not speaking to us himself, but we returned his civility with thanks,
though not fully resolved what to do, or indeed what might be the meaning
of it in this jealous place; but on inquiry, it was told us he was a
Scots Colonel, who had an honorable command in the city, so that we
agreed to go. This afternoon, we were wholly taken up in seeing an opera
represented by some Neapolitans, performed all in excellent music with
rare scenes, in which there acted a celebrated beauty.

Next morning, we went to the Colonel's, who had sent his servant again to
conduct us to his house, which we found to be a noble palace, richly
furnished. There were other guests, all soldiers, one of them a
Scotchman, but we could not learn one of their names. At dinner, he
excused his rudeness that he had not himself spoken to us; telling us it
was his custom, when he heard of any English travelers (who but rarely
would be known to pass through that city for fear of the Inquisition), to
invite them to his house, where they might be free. We had a sumptuous
dinner; and the wine was so tempting, that after some healths had gone
about, and we had risen from the table, the Colonel led us into his hall,
where there hung up divers colors, saddles, bridles, pistols, and other
arms, being trophies which he had taken with his own hands from the
enemy; among them, he would needs bestow a pair of pistols on Captain
Wray, one of our fellow-travelers, and a good drinking gentleman, and on
me a Turkish bridle woven with silk and very curiously embossed, with
other silk trappings, to which hung a half moon finely wrought, which he
had taken from a bashaw whom he had slain. With this glorious spoil, I
rode the rest of my journey as far as Paris, and brought it afterward
into England. He then showed us a stable of brave horses, with his menage
and cavalerizzo. Some of the horses he caused to be brought out, which he
mounted, and performed all the motions of an excellent horseman. When
this was done, and he had alighted,--contrary to the advice of his groom
and page, who knew the nature of the beast, and that their master was a
little spirited with wine, he would have a fiery horse that had not yet
been managed and was very ungovernable, but was otherwise a very
beautiful creature; this he mounting, the horse, getting the reins in a
full _carriere_, rose so desperately that he fell quite back, crushing
the Colonel so forcibly against the wall of the menage, that though he
sat on him like a Centaur, yet recovering the jade on all fours again, he
desired to be taken down and so led in, where he cast himself on a
pallet; and, with infinite lamentations, after some time we took leave of
him, being now speechless. The next morning, going to visit him, we found
before the door the canopy which they usually carry over the host, and
some with lighted tapers; which made us suspect he was in a very sad
condition, and so indeed we found him, an Irish Friar standing by his
bedside as confessing him, or at least disguising a confession, and
other ceremonies used _in extremis_; for we afterward learned that the
gentleman was a Protestant, and had this Friar, his confidant; which was
a dangerous thing at Milan, had it been but suspected. At our entrance,
he sighed grievously, and held up his hands, but was not able to speak.
After vomiting some blood, he kindly took us all by the hand, and made
signs that he should see us no more, which made us take our leave of him
with extreme reluctancy and affliction for the accident. This sad
disaster made us consult about our departure as soon as we could, not
knowing how we might be inquired after, or engaged, the Inquisition being
so cruelly formidable and inevitable, on the least suspicion. The next
morning, therefore, discharging our lodgings, we agreed for a coach to
carry us to the foot of the Alps, not a little concerned for the death of
the Colonel, which we now heard of, and who had so courteously
entertained us.

The first day we got as far as Castellanza, by which runs a considerable
river into Lago Maggiore; here, at dinner, were two or three Jesuits, who
were very pragmatical and inquisitive, whom we declined conversation with
as decently as we could; so we pursued our journey through a most
fruitful plain, but the weather was wet and uncomfortable. At night, we
lay at Sesto.

The next morning, leaving our coach, we embarked in a boat to carry us
over the lake (being one of the largest in Europe), and whence we could
see the towering Alps, and among them the great San Bernardo, esteemed
the highest mountain in Europe, appearing to be some miles above the
clouds. Through this vast water, passes the river Ticinus, which
discharges itself into the Po, by which means Helvetia transports her
merchandizes into Italy, which we now begin to leave behind us.

Having now sailed about two leagues, we were hauled ashore at Arona, a
strong town belonging to the Duchy of Milan, where, being examined by the
Governor, and paying a small duty, we were dismissed. Opposite to this
fort, is Angiera, another small town, the passage very pleasant with the
prospect of the Alps covered with pine and fir trees, and above them
snow. We passed the pretty island Isabella, about the middle of the
lake, on which is a fair house built on a mount; indeed, the whole island
is a mount ascended by several terraces and walks all set above with
orange and citron trees.

[Sidenote: ISOLA]

The next we saw was Isola, and we left on our right hand the Isle of St.
Jovanni; and so sailing by another small town built also on an island, we
arrived at night at Margazzo, an obscure village at the end of the lake,
and at the very foot of the Alps, which now rise as it were suddenly
after some hundreds of miles of the most even country in the world, and
where there is hardly a stone to be found, as if Nature had here swept up
the rubbish of the earth in the Alps, to form and clear the plains of
Lombardy, which we had hitherto passed since our coming from Venice. In
this wretched place, I lay on a bed stuffed with leaves, which made such
a crackling and did so prick my skin through the tick, that I could not
sleep. The next morning, I was furnished with an ass, for we could not
get horses; instead of stirrups, we had ropes tied with a loop to put our
feet in, which supplied the place of other trappings. Thus, with my
gallant steed, bridled with my Turkish present, we passed through a
reasonably pleasant but very narrow valley, till we came to Duomo, where
we rested, and, having showed the Spanish pass, the Governor would press
another on us, that his secretary might get a crown. Here we exchanged
our asses for mules, sure-footed on the hills and precipices, being
accustomed to pass them. Hiring a guide, we were brought that night
through very steep, craggy, and dangerous passages to a village called
Vedra, being the last of the King of Spain's dominions in the Duchy of
Milan. We had a very infamous wretched lodging.

The next morning we mounted again through strange, horrid, and fearful
crags and tracts, abounding in pine trees, and only inhabited by bears,
wolves, and wild goats; nor could we anywhere see above a pistol shot
before us, the horizon being terminated with rocks and mountains, whose
tops, covered with snow, seemed to touch the skies, and in many places
pierced the clouds. Some of these vast mountains were but one entire
stone, between whose clefts now and then precipitated great cataracts of
melted snow, and other waters, which made a terrible roaring, echoing
from the rocks and cavities; and these waters in some places breaking in
the fall, wet us as if we had passed through a mist, so as we could
neither see nor hear one another, but, trusting to our honest mules, we
jogged on our way. The narrow bridges, in some places made only by
felling huge fir trees, and laying them athwart from mountain to
mountain, over cataracts of stupendous depth, are very dangerous, and so
are the passages and edges made by cutting away the main rock; others in
steps; and in some places we pass between mountains that have been broken
and fallen on one another; which is very terrible, and one had need of a
sure foot and steady head to climb some of these precipices, besides that
they are harbors for bears and wolves, who have sometimes assaulted
travelers. In these straits, we frequently alighted, now freezing in the
snow, and anon frying by the reverberation of the sun against the cliffs
as we descend lower, when we meet now and then a few miserable cottages
so built upon the declining of the rocks, as one would expect their
sliding down. Among these, inhabit a goodly sort of people, having
monstrous gullets, or wens of flesh, growing to their throats, some of
which I have seen as big as an hundred pound bag of silver hanging under
their chins; among the women especially, and that so ponderous, as that
to ease them, many wear linen cloth bound about their head, and coming
under the chin to support it; but _quis tumidum guttur miratur in
Alpibus?_ Their drinking so much snow water is thought to be the cause of
it; the men using more wine, are not so strumous as the women. The truth
is, they are a peculiar race of people, and many great water drinkers
here have not these prodigious tumors; it runs, as we say, in the blood,
and is a vice in the race, and renders them so ugly, shriveled and
deformed, by its drawing the skin of the face down, that nothing can be
more frightful; to this add a strange puffing dress, furs, and that
barbarous language, being a mixture of corrupt High German, French, and
Italian. The people are of great stature, extremely fierce and rude, yet
very honest and trusty.

[Sidenote: MOUNT SAMPION]

This night, through almost inaccessible heights, we came in prospect of
Mons Sempronius, now Mount Sampion, which has on its summit a few huts
and a chapel. Approaching this, Captain Wray's water spaniel (a huge
filthy cur that had followed him out of England) hunted a herd of goats
down the rocks into a river made by the melting of the snow. Arrived at
our cold harbor (though the house had a stove in every room) and supping
on cheese and milk with wretched wine, we went to bed in cupboards so
high from the floor, that we climbed them by a ladder; we were covered
with feathers, that is, we lay between two ticks stuffed with them, and
all little enough to keep one warm. The ceilings of the rooms are
strangely low for those tall people. The house was now (in September)
half covered with snow, nor is there a tree, or a bush, growing within
many miles.

From this uncomfortable place, we prepared to hasten away the next
morning; but, as we were getting on our mules, comes a huge young fellow
demanding money for a goat which he affirmed that Captain Wray's dog had
killed; expostulating the matter, and impatient of staying in the cold,
we set spurs and endeavored to ride away, when a multitude of people
being by this time gotten together about us (for it being Sunday morning
and attending for the priest to say mass), they stopped our mules, beat
us off our saddles, and, disarming us of our carbines, drew us into one
of the rooms of our lodging, and set a guard upon us. Thus we continued
prisoners till mass was ended, and then came half a score grim Swiss,
who, taking on them to be magistrates, sat down on the table, and
condemned us to pay a pistole for the goat, and ten more for attempting
to ride away, threatening that if we did not pay it speedily, they would
send us to prison, and keep us to a day of public justice, where, as they
perhaps would have exaggerated the crime, for they pretended we had
primed our carbines and would have shot some of them (as indeed the
Captain was about to do), we might have had our heads cut off, as we were
told afterward, for that among these rude people a very small misdemeanor
does often meet that sentence. Though the proceedings appeared highly
unjust, on consultation among ourselves we thought it safer to rid
ourselves out of their hands, and the trouble we were brought into; and
therefore we patiently laid down the money, and with fierce countenances
had our mules and arms delivered to us, and glad we were to escape as we
did. This was cold entertainment, but our journey after was colder, the
rest of the way having been (as they told us) covered with snow since the
Creation; no man remembered it to be without; and because, by the
frequent snowing, the tracks are continually filled up, we passed by
several tall masts set up to guide travelers, so as for many miles they
stand in ken of one another, like to our beacons. In some places, where
there is a cleft between two mountains, the snow fills it up, while the
bottom, being thawed, leaves as it were a frozen arch of snow, and that
so hard as to bear the greatest weight; for as it snows often, so it
perpetually freezes, of which I was so sensible that it flawed the very
skin of my face.

Beginning now to descend a little, Captain Wray's horse (that was our
sumpter and carried all our baggage) plunging through a bank of loose
snow, slid down a frightful precipice, which so incensed the choleric
cavalier, his master, that he was sending a brace of bullets into the
poor beast, lest our guide should recover him, and run away with his
burden; but, just as he was lifting up his carbine, we gave such a shout,
and so pelted the horse with snow-balls, as with all his might plunging
through the snow, he fell from another steep place into another bottom,
near a path we were to pass. It was yet a good while ere we got to him,
but at last we recovered the place, and, easing him of his charge, hauled
him out of the snow, where he had been certainly frozen in, if we had not
prevented it, before night. It was as we judged almost two miles that he
had slid and fallen, yet without any other harm than the benumbing of his
limbs for the present, but, with lusty rubbing and chafing he began to
move, and, after a little walking, performed his journey well enough. All
this way, affrighted with the disaster of this horse, we trudged on foot,
driving our mules before us; sometimes we fell, sometimes we slid,
through this ocean of snow, which after October is impassible. Toward
night, we came into a larger way, through vast woods of pines, which
clothe the middle parts of these rocks. Here, they were burning some to
make pitch and rosin, peeling the knotty branches, as we do to make
charcoal, reserving what melts from them, which hardens into pitch. We
passed several cascades of dissolved snow, that had made channels of
formidable depth in the crevices of the mountains, and with such a
fearful roaring as we could hear it for seven long miles. It is from
these sources that the Rhone and the Rhine, which pass through all France
and Germany, derive their originals. Late at night, we got to a town
called Briga, at the foot of the Alps, in the Valteline. Almost every
door had nailed on the outside and next the street a bear's, wolf's, or
fox's head, and divers of them, all three; a savage kind of sight, but,
as the Alps are full of the beasts, the people often kill them. The next
morning, we returned to our guide, and took fresh mules, and another to
conduct us to the Lake of Geneva, passing through as pleasant a country
as that we had just traveled was melancholy and troublesome. A strange
and sudden change it seemed; for the reverberation of the sunbeams from
the mountains and rocks that like walls range it on both sides, not above
two flight-shots in breadth, for a very great number of miles, renders
the passage excessively hot. Through such extremes we continued our
journey, that goodly river, the Rhone, gliding by us in a narrow and
quiet channel almost in the middle of this Canton, fertilizing the
country for grass and corn, which grow here in abundance.

[Sidenote: SION]

We arrived this night at Sion, a pretty town and city, a bishop's seat,
and the head of Valesia. There is a castle, and the bishop who resides in
it, has both civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Our host, as the
custom of these Cantons is, was one of the chiefest of the town, and had
been a Colonel in France: he treated us with extreme civility, and was so
displeased at the usage we received at Mount Sampion, that he would needs
give us a letter to the Governor of the country, who resided at St.
Maurice, which was in our way to Geneva, to revenge the affront. This was
a true old blade, and had been a very curious virtuoso, as we found by a
handsome collection of books, medals, pictures, shells, and other
antiquities. He showed two heads and horns of the true capricorn, which
animal he told us was frequently killed among the mountains; one branch
of them was as much as I could well lift, and near as high as my head,
not much unlike the greater sort of goat's, save that they bent forward,
by help whereof they climb up and hang on inaccessible rocks, from whence
the inhabitants now and then shoot them. They speak prodigious things of
their leaping from crag to crag, and of their sure footing,
notwithstanding their being cloven-footed, unapt (one would think) to
take hold and walk so steadily on those horrible ridges as they do. The
Colonel would have given me one of these beams, but the want of a
convenience to carry it along with me, caused me to refuse his courtesy.
He told me that in the castle there were some Roman and Christian
antiquities, and he had some inscriptions in his own garden. He invited
us to his country-house, where he said he had better pictures, and other
rarities; but, our time being short, I could not persuade my companions
to stay and visit the places he would have had us see, nor the offer he
made to show us the hunting of the bear, wolf, and other wild beasts. The
next morning, having presented his daughter, a pretty well-fashioned
young woman, with a small ruby ring, we parted somewhat late from our
generous host.

Passing through the same pleasant valley between the horrid mountains on
either hand, like a gallery many miles in length, we got to Martigni,
where also we were well entertained. The houses in this country are all
built of fir boards, planed within, low, and seldom above one story. The
people very clownish and rusticly clad, after a very odd fashion, for the
most part in blue cloth, very whole and warm, with little variety of
distinction between the gentleman and common sort, by a law of their
country being exceedingly frugal. Add to this their great honesty and
fidelity, though exacting enough for what they part with: I saw not one
beggar. We paid the value of twenty shillings English, for a day's hire
of one horse. Every man goes with a sword by his side, the whole country
well disciplined, and indeed impregnable, which made the Romans have such
ill success against them; one lusty Swiss at their narrow passages is
sufficient to repel a legion. It is a frequent thing here for a young
tradesman, or farmer, to leave his wife and children for twelve or
fifteen years, and seek his fortune in the wars in Spain, France, Italy,
or Germany, and then return again to work. I look upon this country to be
the safest spot of all Europe, neither envied nor envying; nor are any of
them rich, nor poor; they live in great simplicity and tranquillity;
and, though of the fourteen Cantons half be Roman Catholics, the rest
reformed, yet they mutually agree, and are confederate with Geneva, and
are its only security against its potent neighbors, as they themselves
are from being attacked by the greater potentates, by the mutual jealousy
of their neighbors, as either of them would be overbalanced, should the
Swiss, who are wholly mercenary and auxiliaries, be subjected to France
or Spain.

[Sidenote: BEVERETTA]

[Sidenote: GENEVA]

We were now arrived at St. Maurice, a large handsome town and residence
of the President, where justice is done. To him we presented our letter
from Sion, and made known the ill usage we had received for killing a
wretched goat, which so incensed him, that he swore if we would stay he
would not only help us to recover our money again, but most severely
punish the whole rabble; but our desire of revenge had by this time
subsided, and glad we were to be gotten so near France, which we reckoned
as good as home. He courteously invited us to dine with him; but we
excused ourselves, and, returning to our inn, while we were eating
something before we took horse, the Governor had caused two pages to
bring us a present of two great vessels of covered plate full of
excellent wine, in which we drank his health, and rewarded the youths;
they were two vast bowls supported by two Swiss, handsomely wrought after
the German manner. This civility and that of our host at Sion, perfectly
reconciled us to the highlanders; and so, proceeding on our journey we
passed this afternoon through the gate which divides the Valais from the
Duchy of Savoy, into which we were now entering, and so, through Montei,
we arrived that evening at Beveretta. Being extremely weary and
complaining of my head, and finding little accommodation in the house, I
caused one of our hostess's daughters to be removed out of her bed and
went immediately into it while it was yet warm, being so heavy with pain
and drowsiness that I would not stay to have the sheets changed; but I
shortly after paid dearly for my impatience, falling sick of the smallpox
as soon as I came to Geneva, for by the smell of frankincense and the
tale the good woman told me of her daughter having had an ague, I
afterward concluded she had been newly recovered of the smallpox.
Notwithstanding this, I went with my company, the next day, hiring a bark
to carry us over the lake; and indeed, sick as I was, the weather was so
serene and bright, the water so calm, and air so temperate, that never
had travelers a sweeter passage. Thus, we sailed the whole length of the
lake, about thirty miles, the countries bordering on it (Savoy and Berne)
affording one of the most delightful prospects in the world, the Alps
covered with snow, though at a great distance, yet showing their aspiring
tops. Through this lake, the river Rhodanus passes with that velocity as
not to mingle with its exceeding deep waters, which are very clear, and
breed the most celebrated trout for largeness and goodness of any in
Europe. I have ordinarily seen one of three feet in length sold in the
market for a small price, and such we had in the lodging where we abode,
which was at the White Cross. All this while, I held up tolerably; and
the next morning having a letter for Signor John Diodati, the famous
Italian minister and translator of the Holy Bible into that language, I
went to his house, and had a great deal of discourse with that learned
person. He told me he had been in England, driven by tempest into Deal,
while sailing for Holland, that he had seen London, and was exceedingly
taken with the civilities he received. He so much approved of our
Church-government by Bishops, that he told me the French Protestants
would make no scruple to submit to it and all its pomp, had they a king
of the Reformed religion as we had. He exceedingly deplored the
difference now between his Majesty and the Parliament. After dinner, came
one Monsieur Saladine, with his little pupil, the Earl of Caernarvon, to
visit us, offering to carry us to the principal places of the town; but,
being now no more able to hold up my head, I was constrained to keep my
chamber, imagining that my very eyes would have dropped out; and this
night I felt such a stinging about me, that I could not sleep. In the
morning, I was very ill, but sending for a doctor, he persuaded me to be
bled. He was a very learned old man, and, as he said, he had been
physician to Gustavus the Great, King of Sweden, when he passed this way
into Italy, under the name of Monsieur Gars, the initial letters of
Gustavus Adolphus Rex Sueciæ, and of our famous Duke of Buckingham, on
his returning out of Italy. He afterward acknowledged that he should not
have bled me, had he suspected the smallpox, which broke out a day after.
He afterward purged me, and applied leeches, and God knows what this
would have produced, if the spots had not appeared, for he was thinking
of bleeding me again. They now kept me warm in bed for sixteen days,
tended by a vigilant Swiss matron, whose monstrous throat, when I
sometimes awakened out of unquiet slumbers, would affright me. After the
pimples were come forth, which were not many, I had much ease as to pain,
but infinitely afflicted with heat and noisomeness. By God's mercy, after
five weeks' keeping my chamber, I went abroad. Monsieur Saladine and his
lady sent me many refreshments. Monsieur Le Chat, my physician, to excuse
his letting me bleed, told me it was so burnt and vicious as it would
have proved the plague, or spotted fever, had he proceeded by any other
method. On my recovering sufficiently to go abroad, I dined at Monsieur
Saladine's, and in the afternoon went across the water on the side of the
lake, and took a lodging that stood exceedingly pleasant, about half a
mile from the city for the better airing; but I stayed only one night,
having no company there, save my pipe; so, the next day, I caused them to
row me about the lake as far as the great stone, which they call
NEPTUNE'S ROCK, on which they say sacrifice was anciently offered to him.
Thence, I landed at certain cherry gardens and pretty villas by the side
of the lake, and exceedingly pleasant. Returning, I visited their
conservatories of fish; in which were trouts of six and seven feet long,
AS THEY AFFIRMED.

The Rhone, which parts the city in the midst dips into a cavern
underground, about six miles from it, and afterward rises again, and runs
its open course, like our Mole, or Swallow, by Dorking, in Surrey. The
next morning (being Thursday) I heard Dr. Diodati preach in Italian, many
of that country, especially of Lucca, his native place, being inhabitants
of Geneva, and of the Reformed religion.

The town lying between Germany, France, and Italy, those three tongues
are familiarly spoken by the inhabitants. It is a strong, well-fortified
city, part of it built on a rising ground. The houses are not despicable,
but the high pent-houses (for I can hardly call them cloisters, being
all of wood), through which the people pass dry and in the shade, winter
and summer, exceedingly deform the fronts of the buildings. Here are
abundance of booksellers; but their books are of ill impressions; these,
with watches (of which store are made here), crystal, and excellent
screwed guns, are the staple commodities. All provisions are good and
cheap.

The town-house is fairly built of stone; the portico has four black
marble columns; and, on a table of the same, under the city arms, a
demi-eagle and cross, between cross-keys, is a motto, "POST TENEBRAS
LUX," and this inscription:

    _Quum anno 1535 profligatâ Romanâ Anti-Christi Tyrannide,
    abrogatisq; ejus superstitionibus, sacro-sancta Christi Religio hìc
    in suam puritatem, Ecclesiâ in meliorem ordinem singulari Dei
    beneficio repositâ, et simul pulsis fugatisq; hostibus, urbs ipsa
    in suam libertatem, non sine insigni miraculo, restituta fuerit;
    Senatus Populusq; Genevensis Monumentum hoc perpetuæ memoriæ causâ
    fieri atque hoc loco erigi curavit, quod suam erga Deum
    gratitudinem ad posteros testatum fuerit._

The territories about the town are not so large as many ordinary
gentlemen have about their country farms, for which cause they are in
continual watch, especially on the Savoy side; but, in case of any siege
the Swiss are at hand, as this inscription in the same place shows,
toward the street:

                              D.O.M.S.

    _Anno a verâ Religione divinitûs cum veteri Libertate Genevæ
    restitutâ, et quasi novo Jubilæo ineunte, plurimis vitatis domi et
    forsi insidiis et superatis tempestatibus, et cum Helvetiorum
    Primari Tigurini æquo jure in societatem perpetuam nobiscum
    venerint, et veteres fidissimi socii Bernenses prius vinculum novo
    adstrinxerint, S.P.Q.G. quod felix esse velit D.O.M. tanti,
    beneficii monumentum consecrârunt, anno temporis ultimi_
    CC[~C~].I[~C~].XXXIV.

In the Senate-house, were fourteen ancient urns, dug up as they were
removing earth in the fortifications.

A little out of the town is a spacious field, which they call Campus
Martius; and well it may be so termed, with better reason, than that at
Rome at present (which is no more a field, but all built into streets),
for here on every Sunday, after the evening devotions, this precise
people permit their youth to exercise arms, and shoot in guns, and in the
long and cross bows, in which they are exceedingly expert, reputed to be
as dexterous as any people in the world. To encourage this, they yearly
elect him who has won most prizes at the mark, to be their king, as the
king of the long-bow, gun, or cross-bow. He then wears that weapon in his
hat in gold, with a crown over it made fast to the hat like a brooch. In
this field, is a long house wherein their arms and furniture are kept in
several places very neatly. To this joins a hall, where, at certain
times, they meet and feast; in the glass windows are the arms and names
of their kings [of arms]. At the side of the field, is a very noble
Pall-Mall, but it turns with an elbow. There is also a bowling-place, a
tavern, and a trey-table, and here they ride their menaged horses. It is
also the usual place of public execution of those who suffer for any
capital crime, though committed in another country, by which law divers
fugitives have been put to death, who have fled hither to escape
punishment in their own country. Among other severe punishments here,
adultery is death. Having seen this field, and played a game at mall, I
supped with Mr. Saladine.

On Sunday, I heard Dr. Diodati preach in French, and after the French
mode, in a gown with a cape, and his hat on. The Church Government is
severely Presbyterian, after the discipline of Calvin and Beza, who set
it up, but nothing so rigid as either our Scots or English sectaries of
that denomination. In the afternoon, Monsieur Morice, a most learned
young person and excellent poet, chief Professor of the University,
preached at St. Peter's, a spacious Gothic fabric. This was heretofore a
cathedral and a reverend pile. It has four turrets, on one of which
stands a continual sentinel; in another cannons are mounted. The church
is very decent within; nor have they at all defaced the painted windows,
which are full of pictures of saints; nor the stalls, which are all
carved with the history of our Blessed Savior.

In the afternoon, I went to see the young townsmen exercise in Mars'
Field, where the prizes were pewter-plates and dishes; 'tis said that
some have gained competent estates by what they have thus won. Here I
first saw huge ballistæ, or cross-bows, shot in, being such as they
formerly used in wars, before great guns were known; they were placed in
frames, and had great screws to bend them, doing execution at an
incredible distance. They were most accurate at the long-bow and musket,
rarely missing the smallest mark. I was as busy with the carbine I
brought from Brescia as any of them. After every shot, I found them go
into a long house, and cleanse their guns, before they charged again.

On Monday, I was invited to a little garden without the works, where were
many rare tulips, anemones, and other choice flowers. The Rhone, running
athwart the town out of the Lake, makes half the city a suburb, which, in
imitation of Paris, they call St. Germain's Fauxbourg, and it has a
church of the same name. On two wooden bridges that cross the river are
several water-mills, and shops of trades, especially smiths and cutlers;
between the bridges is an island, in the midst of which is a very ancient
tower, said to have been built by Julius Cæsar. At the end of the other
bridge is the mint, and a fair sun-dial.

Passing again by the town-house, I saw a large crocodile hanging in
chains; and against the wall of one of the chambers, seven judges were
painted without hands, except one in the middle, who has but one hand; I
know not the story. The Arsenal is at the end of this building, well
furnished and kept.

After dinner Mr. Morice led us to the college, a fair structure; in the
lower part are the schools, which consist of nine classes; and a hall
above, where the students assemble; also a good library. They showed us a
very ancient Bible, of about 300 years old, in the vulgar French, and a
MS. in the old Monkish character: here have the Professors their
lodgings. I also went to the Hospital, which is very commodious; but the
Bishop's Palace is now a prison.

This town is not much celebrated for beautiful women, for, even at this
distance from the Alps, the gentlewomen have somewhat full throats; but
our Captain Wray (afterward Sir William, eldest son of that Sir
Christopher, who had both been in arms against his Majesty for the
Parliament) fell so mightily in love with one of Monsieur Saladine's
daughters that, with much persuasion, he could not be prevailed on to
think on his journey into France, the season now coming on extremely hot.

My sickness and abode here cost me forty-five pistoles of gold to my
host, and five to my honest doctor, who for six weeks' attendance and the
apothecary thought it so generous a reward that, at my taking leave, he
presented me with his advice for the regimen of my health, written with
his own hand in Latin. This regimen I much observed, and I bless God
passed the journey without inconvenience from sickness, but it was an
extraordinarily hot unpleasant season and journey, by reason of the
craggy ways.

5th July, 1646. We took, or rather purchased, a boat, for it could not be
brought back against the stream of the Rhone. We were two days going to
Lyons, passing many admirable prospects of rocks and cliffs, and near the
town down a very steep declivity of water for a full mile. From Lyons, we
proceeded the next morning, taking horse to Roanne, and lay that night at
Feurs. At Roanne we indulged ourselves with the best that all France
affords, for here the provisions are choice and plentiful, so as the
supper we had might have satisfied a prince. We lay in damask beds, and
were treated like emperors. The town is one of the neatest built in all
France, on the brink of the Loire; and here we agreed with an old fisher
to row us as far as Orleans. The first night we came as far as Nevers,
early enough to see the town, the Cathedral (St. Cyre), the Jesuits'
College, and the Castle, a palace of the Duke's, with the bridge to it
nobly built.

The next day we passed by La Charité, a pretty town, somewhat distant
from the river. Here I lost my faithful spaniel Piccioli, who had
followed me from Rome. It seems he had been taken up by some of the
Governor's pages, or footmen, without recovery; which was a great
displeasure to me, because the cur had many useful qualities.

[Sidenote: ORLEANS]

The next day we arrived at Orleans, taking our turns to row, of which I
reckon my share came to little less than twenty leagues. Sometimes, we
footed it through pleasant fields and meadows; sometimes, we shot at
fowls, and other birds; nothing came amiss: sometimes, we played at
cards, while others sung, or were composing verses; for we had the great
poet, Mr. Waller, in our company, and some other ingenious persons.

At Orleans we abode but one day; the next, leaving our mad Captain behind
us, I arrived at Paris, rejoiced that, after so many disasters and
accidents in a tedious peregrination, I was gotten so near home, and
here I resolved to rest myself before I went further.

It was now October, and the only time that in my whole life that I spent
most idly, tempted from my more profitable recesses; but I soon recovered
my better resolutions and fell to my study, learning the High Dutch and
Spanish tongues, and now and then refreshing my dancing, and such
exercises as I had long omitted, and which are not in much reputation
among the sober Italians.

28th January, 1647. I changed my lodging in the Place de Monsieur de
Metz, near the Abbey of St. Germains; and thence, on the 12th of
February, to another in Rue Columbier, where I had a very fair apartment,
which cost me four pistoles per month. The 18th, I frequented a course of
Chemistry, the famous Monsieur Le Febure operating upon most of the
nobler processes. March 3d, Monsieur Mercure began to teach me on the
lute, though to small perfection.

In May, I fell sick, and had very weak eyes; for which I was four times
let bleed.

22d May, 1647. My valet (Herbert) robbed me of clothes and plate, to the
value of three score pounds; but, through the diligence of Sir Richard
Browne, his Majesty's Resident at the Court of France, and with whose
lady and family I had contracted a great friendship (and particularly set
my affections on a daughter), I recovered most of them, obtaining of the
Judge, with no small difficulty, that the process against the thief
should not concern his life, being his first offense.

10th June, 1647. We concluded about my marriage, in order to which I went
to St. Germains, where his Majesty, then Prince of Wales, had his court,
to desire of Dr. Earle, then one of his chaplains (since Dean of
Westminster, Clerk of the Closet, and Bishop of Salisbury), that he would
accompany me to Paris, which he did; and, on Thursday, 27th of June,
1647, he married us in Sir Richard Browne's chapel, between the hours of
eleven and twelve, some few select friends being present. And this being
Corpus Christi feast, was solemnly observed in this country; the streets
were sumptuously hung with tapestry, and strewed with flowers.

10th September, 1647. Being called into England, to settle my affairs
after an absence of four years, I took leave of the Prince and Queen,
leaving my wife, yet very young, under the care of an excellent lady and
prudent mother.

4th October, 1647. I sealed and declared my will, and that morning went
from Paris, taking my journey through Rouen, Dieppe, Ville-dieu, and St.
Vallerie, where I stayed one day with Mr. Waller, with whom I had some
affairs, and for which cause I took this circle to Calais, where I
arrived on the 11th, and that night embarking in a packet boat, was by
one o'clock got safe to Dover; for which I heartily put up my thanks to
God who had conducted me safe to my own country, and been merciful to me
through so many aberrations. Hence, taking post, I arrived at London the
next day at evening, being the 2d of October, new style.

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

5th October, 1647. I came to Wotton, the place of my birth, to my
brother, and on the 10th to Hampton Court where I had the honor to kiss
his Majesty's hand, and give him an account of several things I had in
charge, he being now in the power of those execrable villains who not
long after murdered him. I lay at my cousin, Sergeant Hatton's at Thames
Ditton, whence, on the 13th, I went to London.

14th October, 1647. To Sayes Court, at Deptford, in Kent (since my
house), where I found Mr. Pretyman, my wife's uncle, who had charge of it
and the estate about it, during my father-in-law's residence in France.
On the 15th, I again occupied my own chambers in the Middle Temple.

9th November, 1647. My sister opened to me her marriage with Mr.
Glanville.

14th January, 1647-48. From London I went to Wotton to see my young
nephew; and thence to Baynards [in Ewhurst], to visit my brother Richard.

5th February, 1648. Saw a tragi-comedy acted in the cockpit, after there
had been none of these diversions for many years during the war.

28th February, 1648. I went with my noble friend, Sir William Ducy
(afterward Lord Downe), to Thistleworth, where we dined with Sir Clepesby
Crew, and afterward to see the rare miniatures of Peter Oliver, and
rounds of plaster, and then the curious flowers of Mr. Barill's garden,
who has some good medals and pictures. Sir Clepesby has fine Indian
hangings, and a very good chimney-piece of water colors, by Breughel,
which I bought for him.

26th April, 1648. There was a great uproar in London, that the rebel army
quartering at Whitehall, would plunder the City, on which there was
published a Proclamation for all to stand on their guard.

4th May, 1648. Came up the Essex petitioners for an agreement between his
Majesty and the rebels. The 16th, the Surrey men addressed the Parliament
for the same; of which some of them were slain and murdered by Cromwell's
guards, in the new palace yard. I now sold the impropriation of South
Malling, near Lewes, in Sussex, to Messrs. Kemp and Alcock, for £3,000.

30th May, 1648. There was a rising now in Kent, my Lord of Norwich being
at the head of them. Their first rendezvous was in Broome-field, next my
house at Sayes Court, whence they went to Maidstone, and so to
Colchester, where was that memorable siege.

27th June, 1648. I purchased the manor of Hurcott, in Worcestershire, of
my brother George, for £3,300.

1st July, 1648. I sate for my picture, in which there is a Death's head,
to Mr. Walker, that excellent painter.

10th July, 1648. News was brought me of my Lord Francis Villiers being
slain by the rebels near Kingston.

16th August, 1648. I went to Woodcote (in Epsom) to the wedding of my
brother, Richard, who married the daughter and coheir of Esquire Minn,
lately deceased; by which he had a great estate both in land and money on
the death of a brother. The coach in which the bride and bridegroom were,
was overturned in coming home; but no harm was done.

28th August, 1648. To London from Sayes Court, and saw the celebrated
follies of Bartholomew Fair.

16th September, 1648. Came my lately married brother, Richard, and his
wife, to visit me, when I showed them Greenwich, and her Majesty's
Palace, now possessed by the rebels.

28th September, 1648. I went to Albury, to visit the Countess of Arundel,
and returned to Wotton.

31st October, 1648. I went to see my manor of Preston Beckhelvyn, and the
Cliffhouse.

29th November, 1648. Myself, with Mr. Thomas Offley, and Lady Gerrard,
christened my niece Mary, eldest daughter of my brother, George Evelyn,
by my Lady Cotton, his second wife. I presented my niece a piece of plate
which cost me £18, and caused this inscription to be set on it--

                            IN MEMORIAM FACTI.

    ANNO CIC IX. XLIIX. CAL. DECEM. VIII. VIRGINUM CASTISS: XTIANORUM

2d December, 1648. This day I sold my manor of Hurcott for £3,400 to one
Mr. Bridges.

13th December, 1648. The Parliament now sat up the whole night, and
endeavored to have concluded the Isle of Wight Treaty; but were surprised
by the rebel army; the members dispersed, and great confusion every where
in expectation of what would be next.

17th December, 1648. I heard an Italian sermon, in Mercers' Chapel, one
Dr. Middleton, an acquaintance of mine, preaching.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1648. I got privately into the council of the rebel army,
at Whitehall, where I heard horrid villanies.

This was a most exceedingly wet year, neither frost nor snow all the
winter for more than six days in all. Cattle died every where of a
murrain.

1st January, 1648-49. I had a lodging and some books at my
father-in-law's house, Sayes Court.

2d January, 1649. I went to see my old friend and fellow-traveler, Mr.
Henshaw, who had two rare pieces of Stenwyck's perspective.

17th January, 1649. To London. I heard the rebel, Peters, incite the
rebel powers met in the Painted Chamber, to destroy his Majesty; and saw
that archtraitor, Bradshaw, who not long after condemned him.

19th January, 1649. I returned home, passing an extraordinary danger of
being drowned by our wherries falling foul in the night on another vessel
then at anchor, shooting the bridge at three quarters' ebb, for which His
mercy God Almighty be praised.

21st January, 1649. Was published my translation of Liberty and
Servitude, for the preface of which I was severely threatened.

22d January, 1649. I went through a course of chemistry, at Sayes Court.
Now was the Thames frozen over, and horrid tempests of wind.

The villany of the rebels proceeding now so far as to try, condemn, and
murder our excellent King on the 30th of this month, struck me with such
horror, that I kept the day of his martyrdom a fast, and would not be
present at that execrable wickedness; receiving the sad account of it
from my brother George, and Mr. Owen, who came to visit me this
afternoon, and recounted all the circumstances.

1st February, 1649. Now were Duke Hamilton, the Earl of Norwich, Lord
Capell, etc., at their trial before the rebels' NEW COURT OF INJUSTICE.

15th February, 1649. I went to see the collection of one Trean, a rich
merchant, who had some good pictures, especially a rare perspective of
Stenwyck; from thence, to other virtuosos.

The painter, La Neve has an Andromeda, but I think it a copy after
Vandyke from Titian, for the original is in France. Webb, at the
Exchange, has some rare things in miniature, of Breughel's, also Putti,
in twelve squares, that were plundered from Sir James Palmer.

At Du Bois, we saw two tables of Putti, that were gotten, I know not how,
out of the Castle of St. Angelo, by old Petit, thought to be Titian's; he
had some good heads of Palma, and one of Stenwyck. Bellcar showed us an
excellent copy of his Majesty's Sleeping Venus and the Satyr, with other
figures; for now they had plundered, sold, and dispersed a world of rare
paintings of the King's, and his loyal subjects. After all, Sir William
Ducy showed me some excellent things in miniature, and in oil of
Holbein's; Sir Thomas More's head, and a whole-length figure of Edward
VI., which were certainly his Majesty's; also a picture of Queen
Elizabeth; the Lady Isabella Thynne; a rare painting of Rothenhamer,
being a Susanna; and a Magdalen, of Quintin, the blacksmith; also a Henry
VIII., of Holbein; and Francis I., rare indeed, but of whose hand I know
not.

16th February, 1649. Paris being now strictly besieged by the Prince de
Condé, my wife being shut up with her father and mother, I wrote a letter
of consolation to her: and, on the 22d, having recommended Obadiah
Walker, a learned and most ingenious person, to be tutor to, and travel
with, Mr. Hillyard's two sons, returned to Sayes Court.

25th February, 1649. Came to visit me Dr. Joyliffe, discoverer of the
lymphatic vessels, and an excellent anatomist.

26th February, 1649. Came to see me Captain George Evelyn, my kinsman,
the great traveler, and one who believed himself a better architect than
really he was; witness the portico in the Garden at Wotton; yet the great
room at Albury is somewhat better understood. He had a large mind, but
over-built everything.

27th February, 1649. Came out of France my wife's uncle (Paris still
besieged), being robbed at sea by the Dunkirk pirates: I lost, among
other goods, my wife's picture, painted by Monsieur Bourdon.

5th March, 1649. Now were the Lords murdered in the Palace Yard.

18th March, 1649. Mr. Owen, a sequestered and learned minister, preached
in my parlor, and gave us the blessed Sacrament, now wholly out of use in
the parish churches, on which the Presbyterians and fanatics had usurped.

21st March, 1649. I received letters from Paris from my wife, and from
Sir Richard [Browne], with whom I kept up a political correspondence,
with no small danger of being discovered.

25th March, 1649. I heard the Common Prayer (a rare thing in these days)
in St. Peter's, at Paul's Wharf, London; and, in the morning, the
Archbishop of Armagh, that pious person and learned man, Usher, in
Lincoln's-Inn Chapel.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d April, 1649. To London, and inventoried my movables that had hitherto
been dispersed for fear of plundering: wrote into France, touching my
sudden resolutions of coming over to them. On the 8th, again heard an
excellent discourse from Archbishop Usher, on Ephes. 4, v. 26-27.

My Italian collection being now arrived, came Moulins, the great
chirurgeon, to see and admire the Tables of Veins and Arteries, which I
purchased and caused to be drawn out of several human bodies at Padua.

11th April, 1649. Received news out of France that peace was concluded;
dined with Sir Joseph Evelyn, at Westminster; and on the 13th I saw a
private dissection at Moulins's house.

17th April, 1649. I fell dangerously ill of my head; was blistered and
let bleed behind the ears and forehead: on the 23d, began to have ease by
using the fumes of camomile on embers applied to my ears, after all the
physicians had done their best.

29th April, 1649. I saw in London a huge ox bred in Kent, 17 feet in
length, and much higher than I could reach.

12th May, 1649. I purchased the manor of Warley Magna, in Essex: in the
afternoon went to see Gildron's collections of paintings, where I found
Mr. Endymion Porter, of his late Majesty's bedchamber.

17th May, 1649. Went to Putney by water, in the barge with divers ladies,
to see the schools, or colleges, of the young gentlewomen.

19th May, 1649. To see a rare cabinet of one Delabarr, who had some good
paintings, especially a monk at his beads.

30th May, 1649. Unkingship was proclaimed, and his Majesty's statues
thrown down at St. Paul's Portico, and the Exchange.

7th June, 1649. I visited Sir Arthur Hopton[38] (brother to Sir Ralph,
Lord Hopton, that noble hero), who having been Ambassador extraordinary
in Spain, sojourned some time with my father-in-law at Paris, a most
excellent person. Also Signora Lucretia, a Greek lady, whom I knew in
Italy, now come over with her husband, an English gentleman. Also, the
Earl and Countess of Arundel, taking leave of them and other friends now
ready to depart for France. This night was a scuffle between some rebel
soldiers and gentlemen about the Temple.

    [Footnote 38: Sir Arthur Hopton was uncle, not brother, to Lord
    Hopton (so well known for his services to Charles in the course of
    the Civil War).]

June 10th, 1649. Preached the Archbishop of Armagh in Lincoln's-Inn, from
Romans 5, verse 13. I received the blessed Sacrament, preparatory to my
journey.

13th June, 1649. I dined with my worthy friend, Sir John Owen, newly
freed from sentence of death among the lords that suffered. With him was
one Carew, who played incomparably on the Welsh harp; afterward I treated
divers ladies of my relations, in Spring Garden.

This night was buried with great pomp, Dorislaus, slain at the Hague, the
villain who managed the trial against his sacred Majesty.

17th June, 1649. I got a pass from the rebel Bradshaw, then in great
power.

20th June, 1649. I went to Putney, and other places on the Thames, to
take prospects in crayon, to carry into France, where I thought to have
them engraved.

2d July, 1649. I went from Wotton to Godstone (the residence of Sir John
Evelyn), where was also Sir John Evelyn of Wilts., when I took leave of
both Sir Johns and their ladies. Mem. the prodigious memory of Sir John
of Wilts' daughter, since married to Mr. W. Pierrepont, and mother of the
present Earl of Kingston. I returned to Sayes Court this night.

4th July, 1649. Visited Lady Hatton, her lord sojourning at Paris with my
father-in-law.

9th July, 1649. Dined with Sir Walter Pye, and my good friend, Mr. Eaton,
afterward a judge, who corresponded with me in France.

11th July, 1649. Came to see me old Alexander Rosse, the divine historian
and poet; Mr. Henshaw, Mr. Scudamore, and other friends to take leave of
me.

[Sidenote: GRAVESEND]

12th July, 1649. It was about three in the afternoon, I took oars for
Gravesend, accompanied by my cousin, Stephens, and sister, Glanville, who
there supped with me and returned; whence I took post immediately to
Dover, where I arrived by nine in the morning; and, about eleven that
night, went on board a barque guarded by a pinnace of eight guns; this
being the first time the Packet-boat had obtained a convoy, having
several times before been pillaged. We had a good passage, though chased
for some hours by a pirate, but he dared not attack our frigate, and we
then chased him till he got under the protection of the castle at Calais.
It was a small privateer belonging to the Prince of Wales. I carried over
with me my servant, Richard Hoare, an incomparable writer of several
hands, whom I afterward preferred in the Prerogative Office, at the
return of his Majesty. Lady Catherine Scott, daughter of the Earl of
Norwich, followed us in a shallop, with Mr. Arthur Slingsby, who left
England _incognito_. At the entrance of the town, the Lieutenant
Governor, being on his horse with the guards, let us pass courteously. I
visited Sir Richard Lloyd, an English gentleman, and walked in the
church, where the ornament about the high altar of black marble is very
fine, and there is a good picture of the Assumption. The citadel seems to
be impregnable, and the whole country about it to be laid under water by
sluices for many miles.

16th July, 1649. We departed from Paris, in company with that very
pleasant lady, Lady Catherine Scott, and others. In all this journey we
were greatly apprehensive of parties, which caused us to alight often out
of our coach and walk separately on foot, with our guns on our shoulders,
in all suspected places.

[Sidenote: PARIS]

1st August, 1649. At three in the afternoon we came to St. Denis, saw the
rarities of the church and treasury; and so to Paris that evening.

The next day, came to welcome me at dinner the Lord High Treasurer
Cottington, Sir Edward Hyde, Chancellor, Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary
of State, Sir George Carteret, Governor of Jersey, and Dr. Earle, having
now been absent from my wife above a year and a half.

18th August, 1649. I went to St. Germains, to kiss his Majesty's hand; in
the coach, which was my Lord Wilmot's, went Mrs. Barlow, the King's
mistress[39] and mother to the Duke of Monmouth, a brown, beautiful,
bold, but insipid creature.

    [Footnote 39: The lady here referred to was Lucy, daughter of
    Richard Walters, Esq., of Haverfordwest. She had two children by the
    King; James, subsequently so celebrated as the Duke of Monmouth, and
    Mary, whose lot was obscure in comparison with that of her brother,
    but of course infinitely happier. She married a Mr. William
    Sarsfield, of Ireland, and after his death, William Fanshawe, Esq.]

19th August, 1649. I went to salute the French King and the Queen
Dowager; and, on the 21st, returned in one of the Queen's coaches with my
Lord Germain, Duke of Buckingham, Lord Wentworth, and Mr. Croftes, since
Lord Croftes.

7th September, 1649. Went with my wife and dear Cousin to St. Germains,
and kissed the Queen-Mother's hand; dined with my Lord Keeper and Lord
Hatton. Divers of the great men of France came to see the King. The next
day, came the Prince of Condé. Returning to Paris, we went to see the
President Maison's palace, built castle-wise, of a milk-white fine
freestone; the house not vast, but well contrived, especially the
staircase, and the ornaments of Putti, about it. It is environed in a dry
moat, the offices under ground, the gardens very excellent with
extraordinary long walks, set with elms, and a noble prospect toward the
forest, and on the Seine toward Paris. Take it altogether, the meadows,
walks, river, forest, corn-ground, and vineyards, I hardly saw anything
in Italy to exceed it. The iron gates are very magnificent. He has pulled
down a whole village to make room for his pleasure about it.

12th September, 1649. Dr. Crighton, a Scotchman, and one of his Majesty's
chaplains, a learned Grecian who set out the Council of Florence,
preached.

13th September, 1649. The King invited the Prince of Condé to supper at
St. Cloud; there I kissed the Duke of York's hand in the tennis court,
where I saw a famous match between Monsieur Saumeurs and Colonel Cooke,
and so returned to Paris. It was noised about that I was knighted, a
dignity I often declined.

1st October, 1649. Went with my cousin Tuke (afterward Sir Samuel), to
see the fountains of St. Cloud and Ruel; and, after dinner, to talk with
the poor ignorant and superstitious anchorite at Mount Calvary, and so to
Paris.

2d October, 1649. Came Mr. William Coventry (afterward Sir William) and
the Duke's secretary, etc., to visit me.

5th October, 1649. Dined with Sir George Ratcliffe, the great favorite of
the late Earl of Stratford, formerly Lord Deputy of Ireland, decapitated.

7th October, 1649. To the Louvre, to visit the Countess of Moreton,
governess to Madame.

15th October, 1649. Came news of Drogheda being taken by the rebels, and
all put to the sword, which made us very sad, forerunning the loss of all
Ireland.

21st October, 1649. I went to hear Dr. d'Avinson's lecture in the
physical garden, and see his laboratory, he being Prefect of that
excellent garden, and Professor Botanicus.

30th October, 1649. I was at the funeral of one Mr. Downes, a sober
English gentleman. We accompanied his corpse to Charenton, where he was
interred in a cabbage-garden, yet with the office of our church, which
was said before in our chapel at Paris. Here I saw also where they buried
the great soldier, Gassion, who had a tomb built over him like a
fountain, the design and materials mean enough. I returned to Paris with
Sir Philip Musgrave, and Sir Marmaduke Langdale, since Lord
Langdale.--Memorandum. This was a very sickly and mortal autumn.

5th November, 1649. I received divers letters out of England, requiring
me to come over about settling some of my concerns.

7th November, 1649. Dr. George Morley (since Bishop of Winchester)
preached in our chapel on Matthew 4, verse 3.

18th November, 1649. I went with my father-in-law to see his audience at
the French Court, where next the Pope's Nuncio, he was introduced by the
master of ceremonies, and, after delivery of his credentials, as from our
King, since his father's murder, he was most graciously received by the
King of France and his mother, with whom he had a long audience. This was
in the Palais Cardinal.

After this, being presented to his Majesty and the Queen Regent I went to
see the house built by the late great Cardinal de Richelieu. The most
observable thing is the gallery, painted with the portraits of the most
illustrious persons and single actions in France, with innumerable
emblems between every table. In the middle of the gallery, is a neat
chapel, rarely paved in work and devices of several sorts of marble,
besides the altar-piece and two statues of white marble, one of St. John,
the other of the Virgin Mary, by Bernini. The rest of the apartments are
rarely gilded and carved, with some good modern paintings. In the
presence hang three huge branches of crystal. In the French King's
bedchamber, is an alcove like another chamber, set as it were in a
chamber like a movable box, with a rich embroidered bed. The fabric of
the palace is not magnificent, being but of two stories; but the garden
is so spacious as to contain a noble basin and fountain continually
playing, and there is a mall, with an elbow, or turning, to protract it.
So I left his Majesty on the terrace, busy in seeing a bull-baiting, and
returned home in Prince Edward's coach with Mr. Paul, the Prince
Elector's agent.

19th November, 1649. Visited Mr. Waller, where meeting Dr. Holden, an
English Sorbonne divine, we fell into some discourse about religion.

28th December, 1649. Going to wait on Mr. Waller, I viewed St. Stephen's
church; the building, though Gothic, is full of carving; within it is
beautiful, especially the choir and winding stairs. The glass is well
painted, and the tapestry hung up this day about the choir, representing
the conversion of Constantine, was exceedingly rich.

I went to that excellent engraver, Du Bosse, for his instruction about
some difficulties in perspective which were delivered in his book.

I concluded this year in health, for which I gave solemn thanks to
Almighty God.[40]

    [Footnote 40: This he does not fail to repeat at the end of every
    year, but it will not always be necessary here to insert it.]

29th December, 1649. I christened Sir Hugh Rilie's child with Sir George
Radcliffe in our chapel, the parents being so poor that they had provided
no gossips, so as several of us drawing lots it fell on me, the Dean of
Peterborough (Dr. Cousin) officiating: we named it Andrew, being on the
eve of that Apostle's day.

1st January, 1649-50. I began this Jubilee with the public office in our
chapel: dined at my Lady Herbert's, wife of Sir Edward Herbert, afterward
Lord Keeper.

18th January, 1650. This night was the Prince of Condé and his brother
carried prisoners to the Bois de Vincennes.

6th February, 1650. In the evening, came Signor Alessandro, one of the
Cardinal Mazarine's musicians, and a person of great name for his
knowledge in that art, to visit my wife, and sung before divers persons
of quality in my chamber.

1st March, 1650. I went to see the masquerados, which was very fantastic;
but nothing so quiet and solemn as I found it at Venice.

13th March, 1650. Saw a triumph in Monsieur del Camp's Academy, where
divers of the French and English noblesse, especially my Lord of Ossory,
and Richard, sons to the Marquis of Ormond (afterward Duke), did their
exercises on horseback in noble equipage, before a world of spectators
and great persons, men and ladies. It ended in a collation.

25th April, 1650. I went out of town to see Madrid, a palace so called,
built by Francis I. It is observable only for its open manner of
architecture, being much of terraces and galleries one over another to
the very roof; and for the materials, which are mostly of earth painted
like porcelain, or China-ware, whose colors appear very fresh, but is
very fragile. There are whole statues and relievos of this pottery,
chimney-pieces, and columns both within and without. Under the chapel is
a chimney in the midst of a room parted from the _Salle des Gardes_. The
house is fortified with a deep ditch, and has an admirable vista toward
the Bois de Boulogne and river.

30th April, 1650. I went to see the collection of the famous sculptor,
Steffano de la Bella, returning now into Italy, and bought some prints;
and likewise visited Perelle, the landscape graver.

3d May, 1650. At the hospital of La Charité I saw the operation of
cutting for the stone. A child of eight or nine years old underwent the
operation with most extraordinary patience, and expressing great joy when
he saw the stone was drawn. The use I made of it was, to give Almighty
God hearty thanks that I had not been subject to this deplorable
infirmity.

7th May, 1650. I went with Sir Richard Browne's lady and my wife,
together with the Earl of Chesterfield, Lord Ossory and his brother, to
Vamber, a place near the city famous for butter; when, coming homeward,
being on foot, a quarrel arose between Lord Ossory and a man in a garden,
who thrust Lord Ossory from the gate with uncivil language; on which our
young gallants struck the fellow on the pate, and bade him ask pardon,
which he did with much submission, and so we parted. But we were not gone
far before we heard a noise behind us, and saw people coming with guns,
swords, staves, and forks, and who followed, flinging stones; on which,
we turned, and were forced to engage, and with our swords, stones, and
the help of our servants (one of whom had a pistol) made our retreat for
near a quarter of a mile, when we took shelter in a house, where we were
besieged, and at length forced to submit to be prisoners. Lord Hatton,
with some others, were taken prisoners in the flight, and his lordship
was confined under three locks and as many doors in this rude fellow's
master's house, who pretended to be steward to Monsieur St. Germain, one
of the presidents of the Grand Chambre du Parlement, and a Canon of Nôtre
Dame. Several of us were much hurt. One of our lackeys escaping to Paris,
caused the bailiff of St. Germain to come with his guard and rescue us.
Immediately afterward, came Monsieur St. Germain himself, in great wrath,
on hearing that his housekeeper was assaulted; but when he saw the King's
officers, the gentlemen and noblemen, with his Majesty's Resident and
understood the occasion, he was ashamed of the accident, requesting the
fellow's pardon, and desiring the ladies to accept their submission and a
supper at his house. It was ten o'clock at night ere we got to Paris,
guarded by Prince Griffith (a Welsh hero going under that name, and well
known in England for his extravagancies), together with the scholars of
two academies, who came forth to assist and meet us on horseback, and
would fain have alarmed the town we received the affront from: which,
with much ado, we prevented.

12th May, 1650. Complaint being come to the Queen and Court of France of
the affront we had received, the President was ordered to ask pardon of
Sir R. Browne, his Majesty's Resident, and the fellow to make submission,
and be dismissed. There came along with him the President de Thou, son of
the great Thuanus [the historian], and so all was composed. But I have
often heard that gallant gentleman, my Lord Ossory, affirm solemnly that
in all the conflicts he was ever in at sea or on land (in the most
desperate of both which he had often been), he believed he was never in
so much danger as when these people rose against us. He used to call it
the _bataile de Vambre_, and remember it with a great deal of mirth as an
adventure, _en cavalier_.

24th May, 1650. We were invited by the Noble Academies to a running at
the ring where were many brave horses, gallants, and ladies, my Lord
Stanhope entertaining us with a collation.

12th June, 1650. Being Trinity Sunday, the Dean of Peterborough preached;
after which there was an ordination of two divines, Durell and Brevent
(the one was afterward Dean of Windsor, the other of Durham, both very
learned persons). The Bishop of Galloway officiated with great gravity,
after a pious and learned exhortation declaring the weight and dignity of
their function, especially now in a time of the poor Church of England's
affliction. He magnified the sublimity of the calling, from the object,
viz, the salvation of men's souls, and the glory of God; producing many
human instances of the transitoriness and vanity of all other dignity;
that of all the triumphs the Roman conquerors made, none was comparable
to that of our Blessed Savior's, when he led captivity captive, and gave
gifts to men, namely, that of the Holy Spirit, by which his faithful and
painful ministers triumphed over Satan as often as they reduced a sinner
from the error of his ways. He then proceeded to the ordination. They
were presented by the Dean in their surplices before the altar, the
Bishop sitting in a chair at one side; and so were made both Deacons and
Priests at the same time, in regard to the necessity of the times, there
being so few Bishops left in England, and consequently danger of a
failure of both functions. Lastly, they proceeded to the Communion. This
was all performed in Sir Richard Browne's chapel, at Paris.

13th June, 1650. I sate to the famous sculptor, Nanteuil, who was
afterward made a knight by the French King for his art. He engraved my
picture in copper. At a future time he presented me with my own picture,
done all with his pen; an extraordinary curiosity.

21st June, 1650. I went to see the Samaritan, or pump, at the end of the
Pont Neuf, which, though to appearance promising no great matter, is,
besides the machine, furnished with innumerable rarities both of art and
nature; especially the costly grotto, where are the fairest corals,
growing out of the very rock, that I have seen; also great pieces of
crystals, amethysts, gold in the mine, and other metals and marcasites,
with two great conchas, which the owner told us cost him 200 crowns at
Amsterdam. He showed us many landscapes and prospects, very rarely
painted in miniature, some with the pen and crayon; divers antiquities
and relievos of Rome; above all, that of the inside of the amphitheater
of Titus, incomparably drawn by Monsieur St. Clere himself; two boys and
three skeletons, molded by Fiamingo; a book of statues, with the pen
made for Henry IV., rarely executed, and by which one may discover many
errors in the _taille-douce_ of Perrier, who has added divers conceits of
his own that are not in the originals. He has likewise an infinite
collection of _taille-douces_, richly bound in morocco.

He led us into a stately chamber furnished to have entertained a prince,
with pictures of the greatest masters, especially a Venus of Perino del
Vaga; the Putti carved in the chimney-piece by the Fleming; the vases of
porcelain, and many designed by Raphael; some paintings of Poussin, and
Fioravanti; antiques in brass; the looking-glass and stands rarely
carved. In a word, all was great, choice, and magnificent, and not to be
passed by as I had often done, without the least suspicion that there
were such rare things to be seen in that place. At a future visit, he
showed a new grotto and a bathing place, hewn through the battlements of
the arches of Pont Neuf into a wide vault at the intercolumniation, so
that the coaches and horses thundered over our heads.

27th June, 1650. I made my will, and, taking leave of my wife and other
friends, took horse for England, paying the messenger eight pistoles for
me and my servant to Calais, setting out with seventeen in company
well-armed, some Portuguese, Swiss, and French, whereof six were captains
and officers. We came the first night to Beaumont; next day, to Beauvais,
and lay at Pois, and the next, without dining, reached Abbeville; next,
dined at Montreuil, and proceeding met a company on foot (being now
within the inroads of the parties which dangerously infest this day's
journey from St. Omers and the frontiers), which we drew very near to,
ready and resolute to charge through, and accordingly were ordered and
led by a captain of our train; but, as we were on the speed, they called
out, and proved to be Scotchmen, newly raised and landed, and few among
them armed. This night, we were well treated at Boulogne. The next day,
we marched in good order, the passage being now exceeding dangerous, and
got to Calais by a little after two. The sun so scorched my face, that it
made the skin peel off.

I dined with Mr. Booth, his Majesty's agent; and, about three in the
afternoon, embarked in the packet-boat; hearing there was a pirate then
also setting sail, we had security from molestation, and so with a fair
S. W. wind in seven hours we landed at Dover. The busy watchman would
have us to the mayor to be searched, but the gentleman being in bed, we
were dismissed.

Next day, being Sunday, they would not permit us to ride post, so that
afternoon our trunks were visited.

The next morning, by four, we set out for Canterbury, where I met with my
Lady Catherine Scott, whom that very day twelve months before I met at
sea going for France; she had been visiting Sir Thomas Peyton, not far
off, and would needs carry me in her coach to Gravesend. We dined at
Sittingbourne, came late to Gravesend, and so to Deptford, taking leave
of my lady about four the next morning.

5th July, 1650. I supped in the city with my Lady Catherine Scott, at one
Mr. Dubois, where was a gentlewoman called Everard, who was a very great
chemist.

Sunday 7th July, 1650. In the afternoon, having a mind to see what was
doing among the Rebels, then in full possession at Whitehall, I went
thither, and found one at exercise in the chapel, after their way;
thence, to St. James's, where another was preaching in the court abroad.

17th July, 1650. I went to London to obtain a pass,[41] intending but a
short stay in England.

    [Footnote 41: A copy of it is subjoined. "These are to will and
    require you to permit and suffer the bearer thereof, John Evelyn,
    Esq., to transport himself, two servants, and other necessaries,
    into any port of France without any your lets or molestations, of
    which you are not to fail, and for which this shall be your
    sufficient warrant. Given at the Council of State at Whitehall this
    25th of June, 1650.

      "Signed in the Name and by Order of the Council of State,
       appointed by authority of Parliament,
       JO. BRADSHAWE, President.

    "To all Customers, Comptrollers and Searchers, and all other
    officers of the Ports, or Customs."

    Subjoined to the signature, Evelyn has added in his own writing;
    "The hand of that villain who sentenced our Charles I. of B[lessed]
    M[emory."] Its endorsement, also in his writing, is, "The Pass from
    the Council of State, 1650."]

25th July, 1650. I went by Epsom to Wotton, saluting Sir Robert Cook and
my sister Glanville; the country was now much molested by soldiers, who
took away gentlemen's horses for the service of the state, as then
called.

4th August, 1650. I heard a sermon at the Rolls; and, in the afternoon,
wandered to divers churches, the pulpits full of novices and novelties.

6th August, 1650. To Mr. Walker's, a good painter, who showed me an
excellent copy of Titian.

12th August, 1650. Set out for Paris, taking post at Gravesend, and so
that night to Canterbury, where being surprised by the soldiers, and
having only an antiquated pass, with some fortunate dexterity I got clear
of them though not without extraordinary hazard, having before
counterfeited one with success, it being so difficult to procure one of
the rebels without entering into oaths, which I never would do. At Dover,
money to the searchers and officers was as authentic as the hand and seal
of Bradshawe himself, where I had not so much as my trunk opened.

[Sidenote: CALAIS]

13th August, 1650. At six in the evening, set sail for Calais; the wind
not favorable, I was very sea-sick, coming to an anchor about one
o'clock; about five in the morning, we had a long boat to carry us to
land, though at a good distance; this we willingly entered, because two
vessels were chasing us; but, being now almost at the harbor's mouth,
through inadvertency there broke in upon us two such heavy seas, as had
almost sunk the boat, I being near the middle up in water. Our steersman,
it seems, apprehensive of the danger, was preparing to leap into the sea
and trust to swimming, but seeing the vessel emerge, he put her into the
pier, and so, God be thanked! we got to Calais, though wet.

Here I waited for company, the passage toward Paris being still infested
with volunteers from the Spanish frontiers.

16th August, 1650. The Regiment of Picardy, consisting of about 1,400
horse and foot (among them was a captain whom I knew), being come to
town, I took horses for myself and servant, and marched under their
protection to Boulogne. It was a miserable spectacle to see how these
tattered soldiers pillaged the poor people of their sheep, poultry, corn,
cattle, and whatever came in their way; but they had such ill pay, that
they were ready themselves to starve.

As we passed St. Denis, the people were in uproar, the guards doubled,
and everybody running with their movables to Paris, on an alarm that the
enemy was within five leagues of them; so miserably exposed was even this
part of France at this time.

[Sidenote: PARIS]

The 30th, I got to Paris, after an absence of two months only.

1st September, 1650. My Lady Herbert invited me to dinner; Paris, and
indeed all France, being full of loyal fugitives.

Came Mr. Waller to see me, about a child of his which the Popish midwife
had baptized.

15th October, 1650. Sir Thomas Osborne (afterward Lord Treasurer) and
Lord Stanhope shot for a wager of five louis, to be spent on a treat;
they shot so exact that it was a drawn match.

1st November, 1650. Took leave of my Lord Stanhope, going on his journey
toward Italy; also visited my Lord Hatton, Comptroller of his Majesty's
Household, the Countess of Morton, Governess to the Lady Henrietta, and
Mrs. Gardner, one of the Queen's maids of honor.

6th November, 1650. Sir Thomas Osborne supping with us, his groom was set
upon in the street before our house, and received two wounds, but gave
the assassin nine, who was carried off to the Charité Hospital. Sir
Thomas went for England on the 8th, and carried divers letters for me to
my friends.

16th November, 1650. I went to Monsieur Visse's, the French King's
Secretary, to a concert of French music and voices, consisting of
twenty-four, two theorbos, and but one bass viol, being a rehearsal of
what was to be sung at vespers at St. Cecilia's, on her feast, she being
patroness of Musicians. News arrived of the death of the Princess of
Orange of the smallpox.

14th December, 1650. I went to visit Mr. Ratcliffe, in whose lodging was
an imposter that had liked to have imposed upon us a pretended secret of
multiplying gold; it is certain he had lived some time in Paris in
extraordinary splendor, but I found him to be an egregious cheat.

22d December, 1650. Came the learned Dr. Boet to visit me.

31st December, 1650. I gave God thanks for his mercy and protection the
past year, and made up my accounts, which came this year to 7,015 livres,
near £600 sterling.

1st January, 1650-51. I wrote to my brother at Wotton, about his garden
and fountains. After evening prayer, Mr. Wainsford called on me: he had
long been Consul at Aleppo, and told me many strange things of those
countries, the Arabs especially.

27th January, 1651. I had letters of the death of Mrs. Newton, my
grand-mother-in-law; she had a most tender care of me during my
childhood, and was a woman of extraordinary charity and piety.

29th January, 1651. Dr. Duncan preached on 8 Matt. v. 34, showing the
mischief of covetousness. My Lord Marquis of Ormonde and Inchiquin, come
newly out of Ireland, were this day at chapel.

9th February, 1651. Cardinal Mazarin was proscribed by Arrêt du
Parlement, and great commotions began in Paris.

23d February, 1651. I went to see the Bonnes Hommes, a convent that has a
fair cloister painted with the lives of hermits; a glorious altar now
erecting in the chapel; the garden on the rock with divers descents, with
a fine vineyard, and a delicate prospect toward the city.

24th February, 1651. I went to see a dromedary, a very monstrous beast,
much like the camel, but larger. There was also dancing on the rope; but,
above all, surprising to those who were ignorant of the address, was the
water-spouter, who, drinking only fountain-water, rendered out of his
mouth in several glasses all sorts of wine and sweet waters. For a piece
of money he discovered the secret to me. I waited on Friar Nicholas at
the convent at Chaillot, who, being an excellent chemist, showed me his
laboratory, and rare collection of spagyrical remedies. He was both
physician and apothecary of the convent, and, instead of the names of his
drugs, he painted his boxes and pots with the figure of the drug, or
simple, contained in them. He showed me as a rarity some [Transcriber's
note: special symbol for the planet Mercury] of antimony. He had cured
Monsieur Senatin of a desperate sickness, for which there was building a
monumental altar that was to cost £1,500.

11th March, 1651. I went to the Châtelet, or prison, where a malefactor
was to have the question, or torture, given to him, he refusing to
confess the robbery with which he was charged, which was thus: they first
bound his wrist with a strong rope, or small cable, and one end of it to
an iron ring made fast to the wall, about four feet from the floor, and
then his feet with another cable, fastened about five feet further than
his utmost length to another ring on the floor of the room. Thus
suspended, and yet lying but aslant, they slid a horse of wood under the
rope which bound his feet, which so exceedingly stiffened it, as severed
the fellow's joints in miserable sort, drawing him out at length in an
extraordinary manner, he having only a pair of linen drawers on his naked
body. Then, they questioned him of a robbery (the lieutenant being
present and a clerk that wrote), which not confessing, they put a higher
horse under the rope, to increase the torture and extension. In this
agony, confessing nothing, the executioner with a horn (just such as they
drench horses with) stuck the end of it into his mouth, and poured the
quantity of two buckets of water down his throat and over him, which so
prodigiously swelled him, as would have pitied and affrighted any one to
see it; for all this, he denied all that was charged to him. They then
let him down, and carried him before a warm fire to bring him to himself,
being now to all appearance dead with pain. What became of him, I know
not; but the gentleman whom he robbed constantly averred him to be the
man, and the fellow's suspicious pale looks, before he knew he should be
racked, betrayed some guilt; the lieutenant was also of that opinion, and
told us at first sight (for he was a lean, dry, black young man) he would
conquer the torture; and so it seems they could not hang him, but did use
in such cases, where the evidence is very presumptive, to send them to
the galleys, which is as bad as death.

There was another malefactor to succeed, but the spectacle was so
uncomfortable, that I was not able to stay the sight of another. It
represented yet to me the intolerable sufferings which our Blessed Savior
must needs undergo, when his body was hanging with all its weight upon
the nails on the cross.

20th March, 1651. I went this night with my wife to a ball at the Marquis
de Crevecoeur's, where were divers princes, dukes, and great persons;
but what appeared to me very mean was, that it began with a puppet-play.

6th May, 1651. I attended the ambassador to a masque at Court, where the
French King in person danced five entries, but being engaged in
discourse, and better entertained with one of the Queen-Regent's
secretaries, I soon left the entertainment.

11th May, 1651. To the Palace Cardinal, where the Master of the
Ceremonies placed me to see the royal masque, or opera. The first scene
represented a chariot of singers composed of the rarest voices that could
be procured, representing Cornaro[42] and Temperance; this was overthrown
by Bacchus and his revelers; the rest consisted of several entries and
pageants of excess, by all the elements. A masque representing fire was
admirable; then came a Venus out of the clouds. The conclusion was a
heaven, whither all ascended. But the glory of the masque was the great
persons performing in it, the French King, his brother the Duke of Anjou,
with all the grandees of the Court, the King performing to the admiration
of all. The music was twenty-nine violins, vested _à l'antique_, but the
habits of the masquers were stupendously rich and glorious.

    [Footnote 42: The famous Venetian writer on Temperance.]

23d May, 1651. I went to take leave of the ambassadors for Spain, which
were my Lord Treasurer Cottington and Sir Edward Hyde; and, as I
returned, I visited Mr. Morine's garden, and his other rarities,
especially corals, minerals, stones, and natural curiosities; crabs of
the Red Sea, the body no bigger than a small bird's egg, but flatter, and
the two legs, or claws, a foot in length. He had abundance of shells, at
least 1,000 sorts, which furnished a cabinet of great price; and had a
very curious collection of scarabees and insects, of which he was
compiling a natural history. He had also the pictures of his choice
flowers and plants in miniature. He told me there were 10,000 sorts of
tulips only. He had _taille-douces_ out of number; the head of the
rhinoceros bird, which was very extravagant, and one butterfly resembling
a perfect bird.

25th May, 1651. I went to visit Mr. Thomas White, a learned priest and
famous philosopher,[43] author of the book "De Mundo," with whose worthy
brother I was well acquainted at Rome. I was shown a cabinet of
Maroquin, or Turkey leather, so curiously inlaid with other leather, and
gilding, that the workman demanded for it 800 livres.

    [Footnote 43: A native of Essex, who was born in 1582, educated
    abroad, and, his family being Catholic, became a priest of that
    church, the sub-rector of the college at Douay. He advocated the
    Cartesian philosophy, and this brought him into an extensive
    correspondence with Hobbes and Descartes, in the course of which he
    Latinized his name into Thomas Albius, or De Albis. He died in
    1676.]

The Dean (of Peterborough) preached on the feast of Pentecost,
perstringing those of Geneva for their irreverence of the Blessed Virgin.

4th June, 1651. Trinity Sunday, I was absent from church in the afternoon
on a charitable affair for the Abbess of Bourcharvant, who but for me had
been abused by that chemist, Du Menie. Returning, I stepped into the
Grand Jesuits, who had this high day exposed their Cibarium, made all of
solid gold and imagery, a piece of infinite cost. Dr. Croydon, coming out
of Italy and from Padua, came to see me, on his return to England.

5th June, 1651. I accompanied my Lord Strafford, and some other noble
persons, to hear Madam Lavaran sing, which she did both in French and
Italian excellently well, but her voice was not strong.

7th June, 1651. Corpus Christi Day, there was a grand procession, all the
streets tapestried, several altars erected there, full of images, and
other rich furniture, especially that before the Court, of a rare design
and architecture. There were abundance of excellent pictures and great
vases of silver.

13th June, 1651. I went to see the collection of one Monsieur Poignant,
which for variety of agates, crystals, onyxes, porcelain, medals,
statues, relievos, paintings, _taille-douces_, and antiquities, might
compare with the Italian virtuosos.

21st June, 1651. I became acquainted with Sieur William Curtius, a very
learned and judicious person of the Palatinate. He had been a scholar to
Alstedius, the Encyclopedist, was well advanced in years, and now
Resident for his Majesty at Frankfort.

2d July, 1651. Came to see me the Earl of Strafford, Lord Ossory and his
brother, Sir John Southcott, Sir Edward Stawell, two of my Lord Spencer's
sons, and Dr. Stewart, Dean of St. Paul's, a learned and pious man, where
we entertained the time upon several subjects, especially the affairs of
England, and the lamentable condition of our Church. The Lord Gerrard
also called to see my collection of sieges and battles.

21st July, 1651. An extraordinary fast was celebrated in our Chapel, Dr.
Stewart, Dean of St. Paul's, preaching.

2d August, 1651. I went with my wife to Conflans, where were abundance of
ladies and others bathing in the river; the ladies had their tents spread
on the water for privacy.

29th August, 1651. Was kept as a solemn fast for the calamities of our
poor Church, now trampled on by the rebels. Mr. Waller, being at St.
Germains, desired me to send him a coach from Paris, to bring my wife's
goddaughter to Paris, to be buried by the Common Prayer.

6th September, 1651. I went with my wife to St. Germains, to condole with
Mr. Waller's loss. I carried with me and treated at dinner that excellent
and pious person the Dean of St. Paul's, Dr. Stewart, and Sir Lewis Dives
(half-brother to the Earl of Bristol), who entertained us with his
wonderful escape out of prison in Whitehall, the very evening before he
was to have been put to death, leaping down out of a jakes two stories
high into the Thames at high water, in the coldest of winter, and at
night; so as by swimming he got to a boat that attended for him, though
he was guarded by six musketeers. After this, he went about in women's
habit, and then in a small-coal-man's, traveling 200 miles on foot,
embarked for Scotland with some men he had raised, who coming on shore
were all surprised and imprisoned on the Marquis of Montrose's score; he
not knowing anything of their barbarous murder of that hero. This he told
us was his fifth escape, and none less miraculous; with this note, that
the charging through 1,000 men armed, or whatever danger could befall a
man, he believed could not more confound and distract a man's thoughts
than the execution of a premeditated escape, the passions of hope and
fear being so strong. This knight was indeed a valiant gentleman; but not
a little given to romance, when he spoke of himself. I returned to Paris
the same evening.

7th September, 1651. I went to visit Mr. Hobbes, the famous philosopher
of Malmesbury, with whom I had long acquaintance. From his window we saw
the whole equipage and glorious cavalcade of the young French Monarch,
Louis XIV., passing to Parliament, when first he took the kingly
government on him, now being in his 14th year, out of his minority and
the Queen Regent's pupilage. First came the captain of the King's Aids,
at the head of 50, richly liveried; next, the Queen-Mother's Light Horse,
100, the lieutenant being all over covered with embroidery and ribbons,
having before him four trumpets habited in black velvet, full of lace,
and casques of the same. Then, the King's Light Horse, 200, richly
habited, with four trumpets in blue velvet embroidered with gold, before
whom rode the Count d'Olonne coronet [cornet], whose belt was set with
pearl. Next went the grand Prévôt's company on foot, with the Prévôt on
horseback; after them, the Swiss in black velvet toques, led by two
gallant cavaliers habited in scarlet-colored satin, after their country
fashion, which is very fantastic; he had in his cap a _pennach_ of heron,
with a band of diamonds, and about him twelve little Swiss boys, with
halberds. Then, came the _Aide des Cérémonies_; next, the grandees of
court, governors of places and lieutenants-general of provinces,
magnificently habited and mounted; among whom I must not forget the
Chevalier Paul, famous for many sea-fights and signal exploits there,
because it is said he had never been an Academist, and yet governed a
very unruly horse, and besides his rich suit his Malta Cross was esteemed
at 10,000 crowns. These were headed by two trumpets, and the whole troop,
covered with gold, jewels, and rich caparisons, were followed by six
trumpets in blue velvet also, preceding as many heralds in blue velvet
_semée_ with fleurs-de-lis, caduces in their hands, and velvet caps on
their heads; behind them, came one of the masters of the ceremonies;
then, divers marshals and many of the nobility, exceeding splendid;
behind them Count d'Harcourt, grand Ecuyer, alone, carrying the King's
sword in a scarf, which he held up in a blue sheath studded with
fleurs-de-lis; his horse had for reins two scarfs of black taffeta.

Then came abundance of footmen and pages of the King, new-liveried with
white and red feathers; next, the _garde du corps_ and other officers;
and lastly, appeared the King himself on an Isabella barb, on which a
housing _semee_, with crosses of the Order of the Holy Ghost, and
fleurs-de-lis; the King himself, like a young Apollo, was in a suit so
covered with rich embroidery, that one could perceive nothing of the
stuff under it; he went almost the whole way with his hat in hand,
saluting the ladies and acclamators, who had filled the windows with
their beauty, and the air with _Vive le Roi_. He seemed a prince of a
grave yet sweet countenance. After the King, followed divers great
persons of the Court, exceeding splendid, also his esquires; masters of
horse, on foot; then the company of _Exempts des Gardes_, and six guards
of Scotch. Between their files were divers princes of the blood, dukes,
and lords; after all these, the Queen's guard of Swiss, pages, and
footmen; then, the Queen-Mother herself, in a rich coach, with Monsieur
the King's brother, the Duke of Orleans, and some other lords and ladies
of honor. About the coach, marched her _Exempts des Gardes_: then the
company of the King's _Gens d'armes_, well mounted, 150, with four
trumpets, and as many of the Queen's; lastly, an innumerable company of
coaches full of ladies and gallants. In this equipage, passed the monarch
to the Parliament, henceforth exercising his kingly government.

15th September, 1651. I accompanied Sir Richard Browne, my father-in-law,
to the French Court, when he had a favorable audience of the French King,
and the Queen, his mother; congratulating the one on his coming to the
exercise of his royal charge, and the other's prudent and happy
administration during her late regency, desiring both to preserve the
same amity for his master, our King, as they had hitherto done, which
they both promised, with many civil expressions and words of course upon
such occasions. We were accompanied both going and returning by the
Introductor of Ambassadors and Aid of Ceremonies. I also saw the audience
of Morosini, the Ambassador of Venice, and divers other Ministers of
State from German Princes, Savoy, etc. Afterward I took a walk in the
King's gardens, where I observed that the mall goes the whole square
there of next the wall, and bends with an angle so made as to glance the
wall; the angle is of stone. There is a basin at the end of the garden
fed by a noble fountain and high jetto. There were in it two or three
boats, in which the King now and then rows about. In another part is a
complete fort, made with bastions, graft, half-moons, ravelins, and
furnished with great guns cast on purpose to instruct the King in
fortification.

22d September, 1651. Arrived the news of the fatal battle at Worcester,
which exceedingly mortified our expectations.

28th September, 1651. I was shown a collection of books and prints made
for the Duke of York.

1st October, 1651. The Dean of Peterborough [Dr. Cosin] preached on Job
xiii., verse 15, encouraging our trust in God on all events and
extremities, and for establishing and comforting some ladies of great
quality, who were then to be discharged from our Queen-Mother's service
unless they would go over to the Romish Mass.

The Dean, dining this day at our house, told me the occasion of
publishing those Offices, which among the Puritans were wont to be called
COSIN'S COZENING DEVOTIONS, by way of derision. At the first coming of
the Queen into England, she and her French ladies were often upbraiding
our religion, that had neither appointed nor set forth any hours of
prayer, or breveries, by which ladies and courtiers, who have much spare
time, might edify and be in devotion, as they had. Our Protestant ladies,
scandalized it seems at this, moved the matter to the King; whereupon his
Majesty presently called Bishop White to him and asked his thoughts of
it, and whether there might not be found some forms of prayer proper on
such occasions, collected out of some already approved forms, that so the
court ladies and others (who spent much time in trifling) might at least
appear as devout, and be so too, as the new-come-over French ladies, who
took occasion to reproach our want of zeal and religion. On which, the
Bishop told his Majesty that it might be done easily, and was very
necessary; whereupon the King commanded him to employ some person of the
clergy to compile such a Work, and presently the Bishop naming Dr. Cosin,
the King enjoined him to charge the Doctor in his name to set about it
immediately. This the Dean told me he did; and three months after,
bringing the book to the King, he commanded the Bishop of London to read
it over, and make his report; this was so well liked, that (contrary to
former custom of doing it by a chaplain) he would needs give it an
_imprimatur_ under his own hand. Upon this there were at first only 200
copies printed; nor, said he, was there anything in the whole book of my
own composure, nor did I set any name as author to it, but those
necessary prefaces, etc., out of the Fathers, touching the times and
seasons of prayer; all the rest being entirely translated and collected
out of an OFFICE published by authority of Queen Elizabeth, anno 1560,
and our own Liturgy. This I rather mention to justify that industrious
and pious Dean, who had exceedingly suffered by it, as if he had done it
of his own head to introduce Popery, from which no man was more averse,
and one who in this time of temptation and apostacy held and confirmed
many to our Church.

29th October, 1651. Came news and letters to the Queen and Sir Richard
Browne (who was the first that had intelligence of it) of his Majesty's
miraculous escape after the fight at Worcester; which exceedingly
rejoiced us.

7th November, 1651. I visited Sir Kenelm Digby, with whom I had much
discourse on chemical matters. I showed him a particular way of
extracting oil of sulphur, and he gave me a certain powder with which he
affirmed that he had fixed [Transcriber's note: special symbol for the
planet Mercury] (mercury) before the late King. He advised me to try and
digest a little better, and gave me a water which he said was only rain
water of the autumnal equinox, exceedingly rectified, very volatile; it
had a taste of a strong vitriolic, and smelt like _aqua fortis_. He
intended it for a dissolvent of calx of gold; but the truth is, Sir
Kenelm was an arrant mountebank. Came news of the gallant Earl of Derby's
execution by the rebels.

14th November, 1651. Dr. Clare preached on Genesis xxviii., verses 20,
21, 22, upon Jacob's vow, which he appositely applied, it being the first
Sunday his Majesty came to chapel after his escape. I went, in the
afternoon, to visit the Earl of Norwich; he lay at the Lord of Aubigny's.

16th November, 1651. Visited Dean Stewart, who had been sick about two
days; when, going up to his lodging, I found him dead; which affected me
much, as besides his particular affection and love to me, he was of
incomparable parts and great learning, of exemplary life, and a very
great loss to the whole church. He was buried the next day with all our
church's ceremonies, many noble persons accompanying the corpse.

17th November, 1651. I went to congratulate the marriage of Mrs. Gardner,
maid of honor, lately married to that odd person, Sir Henry Wood: but
riches do many things.

To see Monsieur Febure's course of chemistry, where I found Sir Kenelm
Digby, and divers curious persons of learning and quality. It was his
first opening the course and preliminaries, in order to operations.

1st December, 1651. I now resolved to return to England.

3d December, 1651. Sir Lewis Dives dined with us, who relating some of
his adventures, showed me divers pieces of broad gold, which, being in
his pocket in a fight, preserved his life by receiving a musket bullet on
them, which deadened its violence, so that it went no further; but made
such a stroke on the gold as fixed the impressions upon one another,
battering and bending several of them; the bullet itself was flatted, and
retained on it the color of the gold. He assured us that of a hundred of
them, which it seems he then had in his pocket, not one escaped without
some blemish. He affirmed that his being protected by a Neapolitan
Prince, who connived at his bringing some horses into France, contrary to
the order of the Viceroy, by assistance of some banditti, was the
occasion of a difference between those great men, and consequently of the
late civil war in that kingdom, the Viceroy having killed the Prince
standing on his defense at his own castle. He told me that the second
time of the Scots coming into England, the King was six times their
number, and might easily have beaten them; but was betrayed, as were all
other his designs and counsels, by some, even of his bedchamber, meaning
M. Hamilton, who copied Montrose's letters from time to time when his
Majesty was asleep.

11th December, 1651. Came to visit me, Mr. Obadiah Walker, of University
College, with his two pupils, the sons of my worthy friend, Henry
Hyldiard, Esq., whom I had recommended to his care.

21st December, 1651. Came to visit my wife, Mrs. Lane,[44] the lady who
conveyed the King to the seaside at his escape from Worcester. Mr. John
Cosin, son of the Dean, debauched by the priests, wrote a letter to me
to mediate for him with his father. I prepared for my last journey, being
now resolved to leave France altogether.

    [Footnote 44: Sister of Colonel Lane, an English officer in the army
    of Charles II. dispersed at the battle of Worcester. She assisted
    the King in effecting his escape after that battle, his Majesty
    traveling with her disguised as her serving man, William Jackson.]

25th December, 1651. The King and Duke received the Sacrament first by
themselves, the Lords Byron and Wilmot holding the long towel all along
the altar.

26th December, 1651. Came news of the death of that rebel, Ireton.

31st December, 1651. Preached Dr. Wolley, after which was celebrated the
Holy Communion, which I received also, preparative of my journey, being
now resolved to leave France altogether, and to return God Almighty
thanks for His gracious protection of me this past year.

2d January, 1651-52. News of my sister Glanville's death in childbed,
which exceedingly affected me.

I went to one Mark Antonio, an incomparable artist in enameling. He
wrought by the lamp figures in boss, of a large size, even to the life,
so that nothing could be better molded. He told us stories of a Genoese
jeweler, who had the great ARCANUM, and had made projection before him
several times. He met him at Cyprus traveling into Egypt; in his return
from whence, he died at sea, and the secret with him, that else he had
promised to have left it to him; that all his effects were seized on, and
dissipated by the Greeks in the vessel, to an immense value. He also
affirmed, that being in a goldsmith's shop at Amsterdam, a person of very
low stature came in, and desired the goldsmith to melt him a pound of
lead; which done, he unscrewed the pommel of his sword, and taking out of
a little box a small quantity of powder, casting it into the crucible,
poured an ingot out, which when cold he took up, saying, "Sir, you will
be paid for your lead in the crucible," and so went out immediately. When
he was gone the goldsmith found four ounces of good gold in it; but could
never set eye again on the little man, though he sought all the city for
him. Antonio asserted this with great obtestation; nor know I what to
think of it, there are so many impostors and people who love to tell
strange stories, as this artist did, who had been a great rover, and
spoke ten different languages.

13th January, 1652. I took leave of Mr. Waller, who, having been
proscribed by the rebels, had obtained of them permission to return, was
going to England.

29th January, 1652. Abundance of my French and English friends and some
Germans came to take leave of me, and I set out in a coach for Calais, in
an exceedingly hard frost which had continued for some time. We got that
night to Beaumont; 30th, to Beauvais; 31st, we found the ways very deep
with snow, and it was exceedingly cold; dined at Pois; lay at Pernèe, a
miserable cottage of miserable people in a wood, wholly unfurnished, but
in a little time we had sorry beds and some provision, which they told me
they hid in the wood for fear of the frontier enemy, the garrisons near
them continually plundering what they had. They were often infested with
wolves. I cannot remember that I ever saw more miserable creatures.

1st February, 1652. I dined at Abbeville; 2d, dined at Montreuil, lay at
Boulogne; 3d, came to Calais, by eleven in the morning; I thought to have
embarked in the evening, but, for fear of pirates plying near the coast,
I dared not trust our small vessel, and stayed till Monday following,
when two or three lusty vessels were to depart.

I brought with me from Paris Mr. Christopher Wase, sometime before made
to resign his Fellowship in King's College, Cambridge, because he would
not take the Covenant. He had been a soldier in Flanders, and came
miserable to Paris. From his excellent learning, and some relation he had
to Sir R. Browne, I bore his charges into England, and clad and provided
for him, till he should find some better condition; and he was worthy of
it. There came with us also Captain Griffith, Mr. Tyrell, brother to Sir
Timothy Tyrell, of Shotover (near Oxford).

At Calais, I dined with my Lord Wentworth, and met with Mr. Heath, Sir
Richard Lloyd, Captain Paine, and divers of our banished friends, of whom
understanding that the Count de la Strade, Governor of Dunkirk, was in
the town, who had bought my wife's picture, taken by pirates at sea the
year before (my wife having sent it for me in England), as my Lord of
Norwich had informed me at Paris, I made my address to him, who frankly
told me that he had such a picture in his own bedchamber among other
ladies, and how he came by it; seeming well pleased that it was his
fortune to preserve it for me, and he generously promised to send it to
any friend I had at Dover; I mentioned a French merchant there and so
took my leave.

6th February, 1652. I embarked early in the packet boat, but put my goods
in a stouter vessel. It was calm, so that we got not to Dover till eight
at night. I took horse for Canterbury, and lay at Rochester; next day, to
Gravesend, took a pair of oars, and landed at Sayes Court, where I stayed
three days to refresh, and look after my packet and goods, sent by a
stouter vessel. I went to visit my cousin, Richard Fanshawe, and divers
other friends.

6th March, 1652. Saw the magnificent funeral of that arch-rebel, Ireton,
carried in pomp from Somerset House to Westminster, accompanied with
divers regiments of soldiers, horse and foot; then marched the mourners,
General Cromwell (his father-in-law), his mock-parliament-men, officers,
and forty poor men in gowns, three led horses in housings of black cloth,
two led in black velvet, and his charging horse, all covered over with
embroidery and gold, on crimson velvet; then the guidons, ensigns, four
heralds, carrying the arms of the State (as they called it), namely, the
red cross and Ireland, with the casque, wreath, sword, spurs, etc.; next,
a chariot canopied of black velvet, and six horses, in which was the
corpse; the pall held up by the mourners on foot; the mace and sword,
with other marks of his charge in Ireland (where he died of the plague),
carried before in black scarfs. Thus, in a grave pace, drums covered with
cloth, soldiers reversing their arms, they proceeded through the streets
in a very solemn manner. This Ireton was a stout rebel, and had been very
bloody to the King's party, witness his severity at Colchester, when in
cold blood he put to death those gallant gentlemen, Sir Charles Lucas and
Sir George Lisle. My cousin, R. Fanshawe, came to visit me, and informed
me of many considerable affairs. Sir Henry Herbert presented me with his
brother, my Lord Cherbury's book, "_De Veritate_."

[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

9th March, 1652. I went to Deptford, where I made preparation for my
settlement, no more intending to go out of England, but endeavor a
settled life, either in this or some other place, there being now so
little appearance of any change for the better, all being entirely in
the rebels' hands; and this particular habitation and the estate
contiguous to it (belonging to my father-in-law, actually in his
Majesty's service) very much suffering for want of some friend to rescue
it out of the power of the usurpers, so as to preserve our interest, and
take some care of my other concerns, by the advice and endeavor of my
friends I was advised to reside in it, and compound with the soldiers.
This I was besides authorized by his Majesty to do, and encouraged with a
promise that what was in lease from the Crown, if ever it pleased God to
restore him, he would secure to us in fee farm. I had also addresses and
cyphers, to correspond with his Majesty and Ministers abroad: upon all
which inducements, I was persuaded to settle henceforth in England,
having now run about the world, most part out of my own country, near ten
years. I therefore now likewise meditated sending over for my wife, whom
as yet I had left at Paris.

14th March, 1652. I went to Lewisham, where I heard an honest sermon on
1 Cor. ii. 5-7, being the first Sunday I had been at church since my
return, it being now a rare thing to find a priest of the Church of
England in a parish pulpit, most of which were filled with Independents
and Fanatics.

15th March, 1652. I saw the "Diamond" and "Ruby" launched in the Dock at
Deptford, carrying forty-eight brass cannon each; Cromwell and his
grandees present, with great acclamations.

18th March, 1652. That worthy divine, Mr. Owen, of Eltham, a sequestered
person, came to visit me.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th March, 1652. Invited by Lady Gerrard, I went to London, where we had
a great supper; all the vessels, which were innumerable, were of
porcelain, she having the most ample and richest collection of that
curiosity in England.

22d March, 1652. I went with my brother Evelyn to Wotton, to give him
what directions I was able about his garden, which he was now desirous to
put into some form; but for which he was to remove a mountain overgrown
with huge trees and thicket, with a moat within ten yards of the house.
This my brother immediately attempted, and that without great cost, for
more than a hundred yards south, by digging down the mountain, and
flinging it into a rapid stream; it not only carried away the sand, etc.,
but filled up the moat, and leveled that noble area, where now the garden
and fountain is. The first occasion of my brother making this alteration
was my building the little retiring place between the great wood eastward
next the meadow, where, some time after my father's death, I made a
triangular pond, or little stew, with an artificial rock after my coming
out of Flanders.

29th March, 1652. I heard that excellent prelate, the primate of Ireland
(Jacobus Usher) preach in Lincoln's Inn, on Heb. iv. 16, encouraging of
penitent sinners.

5th April, 1652. My brother George brought to Sayes Court Cromwell's Act
of Oblivion to all that would submit to the Government.

13th April, 1652. News was brought me that Lady Cotton, my brother
George's wife was delivered of a son.

I was moved by a letter out of France to publish the letter which some
time since I sent to Dean Cosin's proselyted son; but I did not conceive
it convenient, for fear of displeasing her Majesty, the Queen.

15th April, 1652. I wrote to the Dean, touching my buying his library,
which was one of the choicest collections of any private person in
England.

The Count de Strade most generously and handsomely sent me the picture of
my wife from Dunkirk, in a large tin case without any charge. It is of
Mr. Bourdon, and is that which has the dog in it, and is to the knees,
but it has been somewhat spoiled by washing it ignorantly with soapsuds.

25th April, 1652. I went to visit Alderman Kendrick, a fanatic Lord
Mayor, who had married a relation of ours, where I met with a Captain who
had been thirteen times to the East Indies.

29th April, 1652. Was that celebrated eclipse of the sun, so much
threatened by the astrologers, and which had so exceedingly alarmed the
whole nation that hardly any one would work, nor stir out of their
houses. So ridiculously were they abused by knavish and ignorant
star-gazers.

We went this afternoon to see the Queen's house at Greenwich, now given
by the rebels to Bulstrode Whitelocke, one of their unhappy counselors,
and keeper of pretended liberties.

10th May, 1652. Passing by Smithfield, I saw a miserable creature
burning, who had murdered her husband. I went to see some workmanship of
that admirable artist, Reeves, famous for perspective, and turning
curiosities in ivory.

29th May, 1652. I went to give order about a coach to be made against my
wife's coming, being my first coach, the pattern whereof I brought out of
Paris.

30th May, 1652. I went to obtain of my Lord Devonshire that my nephew,
George, might be brought up with my young Lord, his son, to whom I was
recommending Mr. Wase. I also inspected the manner of camleting silk and
grograms at one Monsieur La Dorées in Moor-fields, and thence to Colonel
Morley, one of their Council of State, as then called, who had been my
schoolfellow, to request a pass for my wife's safe landing, and the goods
she was to bring with her out of France; which he courteously granted,
and did me many other kindnesses, that was a great matter in those days.

In the afternoon, at Charlton church, where I heard a Rabinical sermon.
Here is a fair monument in black marble of Sir Adam Newton, who built
that fair house near it for Prince Henry, and where my noble friend, Sir
Henry Newton, succeeded him.

3d June, 1652. I received a letter from Colonel Morley to the Magistrates
and Searchers at Rye, to assist my wife at her landing, and show her all
civility.

4th June, 1652. I set out to meet her now on her journey from Paris,
after she had obtained leave to come out of that city, which had now been
besieged some time by the Prince of Condé's army in the time of the
rebellion, and after she had been now near twelve years from her own
country, that is, since five years of age, at which time she went over. I
went to Rye to meet her, where was an embargo on occasion of the late
conflict with the Holland fleet, the two nations being now in war, and
which made sailing very unsafe.

On Whit Sunday, I went to the church (which is a very fair one), and
heard one of the canters, who dismissed the assembly rudely, and without
any blessing. Here I stayed till the 10th with no small impatience, when
I walked over to survey the ruins of Winchelsea, that ancient cinq-port,
which by the remains and ruins of ancient streets and public structures,
discovers it to have been formerly a considerable and large city. There
are to be seen vast caves and vaults, walls and towers, ruins of
monasteries and of a sumptuous church, in which are some handsome
monuments, especially of the Templars, buried just in the manner of those
in the Temple at London. This place being now all in rubbish, and a few
despicable hovels and cottages only standing, hath yet a Mayor. The sea,
which formerly rendered it a rich and commodious port, has now forsaken
it.

[Sidenote: TUNBRIDGE]

11th June, 1652. About four in the afternoon, being at bowls on the
green, we discovered a vessel which proved to be that in which my wife
was, and which got into the harbor about eight that evening, to my no
small joy. They had been three days at sea, and escaped the Dutch fleet,
through which they passed, taken for fishers, which was great good
fortune, there being seventeen bales of furniture and other rich plunder,
which I bless God came all safe to land, together with my wife, and my
Lady Browne, her mother, who accompanied her. My wife being discomposed
by having been so long at sea, we set not forth toward home till the
14th, when, hearing the smallpox was very rife in and about London, and
Lady Browne having a desire to drink Tunbridge waters, I carried them
thither, and stayed in a very sweet place, private and refreshing, and
took the waters myself till the 23d, when I went to prepare for their
reception, leaving them for the present in their little cottage by the
Wells.

The weather being hot, and having sent my man on before, I rode
negligently under favor of the shade, till, within three miles of
Bromley, at a place called the Procession Oak, two cutthroats started
out, and striking with long staves at the horse, and taking hold of the
reins, threw me down, took my sword, and hauled me into a deep thicket,
some quarter of a mile from the highway, where they might securely rob
me, as they soon did. What they got of money, was not considerable, but
they took two rings, the one an emerald with diamonds, the other an onyx,
and a pair of buckles set with rubies and diamonds, which were of value,
and after all bound my hands behind me, and my feet, having before
pulled off my boots; they then set me up against an oak, with most bloody
threats to cut my throat if I offered to cry out, or make any noise; for
they should be within hearing, I not being the person they looked for. I
told them that if they had not basely surprised me they should not have
had so easy a prize, and that it would teach me never to ride near a
hedge, since, had I been in the midway, they dared not have adventured on
me; at which they cocked their pistols, and told me they had long guns,
too, and were fourteen companions. I begged for my onyx, and told them it
being engraved with my arms would betray them; but nothing prevailed. My
horse's bridle they slipped, and searched the saddle, which they pulled
off, but let the horse graze, and then turning again bridled him and tied
him to a tree, yet so as he might graze, and thus left me bound. My horse
was perhaps not taken, because he was marked and cropped on both ears,
and well known on that road. Left in this manner, grievously was I
tormented with flies, ants, and the sun, nor was my anxiety little how I
should get loose in that solitary place, where I could neither hear nor
see any creature but my poor horse and a few sheep straggling in the
copse.

After near two hours attempting, I got my hands to turn palm to palm,
having been tied back to back, and then it was long before I could slip
the cord over my wrists to my thumb, which at last I did, and then soon
unbound my feet, and saddling my horse and roaming a while about, I at
last perceived dust to rise, and soon after heard the rattling of a cart,
toward which I made, and, by the help of two countrymen, I got back into
the highway. I rode to Colonel Blount's, a great justiciary of the times,
who sent out hue and cry immediately. The next morning, sore as my wrists
and arms were, I went to London, and got 500 tickets printed and
dispersed by an officer of Goldsmiths' Hall, and within two days had
tidings of all I had lost, except my sword, which had a silver hilt, and
some trifles. The rogues had pawned one of my rings for a trifle to a
goldsmith's servant, before the tickets came to the shop, by which means
they escaped; the other ring was bought by a victualer, who brought it
to a goldsmith, but he having seen the ticket seized the man. I afterward
discharged him on his protestation of innocence. Thus did God deliver me
from these villains, and not only so, but restored what they took, as
twice before he had graciously done, both at sea and land, I mean when I
had been robbed by pirates, and was in danger of a considerable loss at
Amsterdam; for which, and many, many signal preservations, I am extremely
obliged to give thanks to God my Savior.

25th June, 1652. After a drought of near four months, there fell so
violent a tempest of hail, rain, wind, thunder, and lightning, as no man
had seen the like in his age; the hail being in some places four or five
inches about, broke all glass about London, especially at Deptford, and
more at Greenwich.

29th June, 1652. I returned to Tunbridge, and again drank the water, till
10th of July.

We went to see the house of my Lord Clanrickarde at Summer hill, near
Tunbridge (now given to that villain, Bradshawe, who condemned the King).
'Tis situated on an eminent hill, with a park; but has nothing else
extraordinary.

4th July, 1652. I heard a sermon at Mr. Packer's chapel at Groomsbridge,
a pretty melancholy seat, well wooded and watered. In this house was one
of the French kings[45] kept prisoner. The chapel was built by Mr.
Packer's father, in remembrance of King Charles the First's safe return
out of Spain.

    [Footnote 45: The Duke of Orleans, taken at the battle of Agincourt,
    4 Hen. V., by Richard Waller, then owner of this place. See Hasted's
    "Kent," vol. i., p. 431.]

[Sidenote: PENSHURST]

9th July, 1652. We went to see Penshurst, the Earl of Leicester's, famous
once for its gardens and excellent fruit, and for the noble conversation
which was wont to meet there, celebrated by that illustrious person, Sir
Philip Sidney, who there composed divers of his pieces. It stands in a
park, is finely watered, and was now full of company, on the marriage of
my old fellow-collegiate, Mr. Robert Smith, who married my Lady Dorothy
Sidney, widow of the Earl of Sunderland.

One of the men who robbed me was taken; I was accordingly summoned to
appear against him; and, on the 12th, was in Westminster Hall, but not
being bound over, nor willing to hang the fellow, I did not appear,
coming only to save a friend's bail; but the bill being found, he was
turned over to the Old Bailey. In the meantime, I received a petition
from the prisoner, whose father I understood was an honest old farmer in
Kent. He was charged, with other crimes, and condemned, but reprieved. I
heard afterward that, had it not been for his companion, a younger man,
he would probably have killed me. He was afterward charged with some
other crime, but, refusing to plead, was pressed to death.

23d July, 1652. Came my old friend, Mr. Spencer, to visit me.

30th July, 1652. I took advice about purchasing Sir Richard's [Browne]
interest of those who had bought Sayes Court.

1st August, 1652. Came old Jerome Lennier, of Greenwich, a man skilled in
painting and music, and another rare musician, called Mell. I went to see
his collection of pictures, especially those of Julio Romano, which
surely had been the King's, and an Egyptian figure, etc. There were also
excellent things of Polydore, Guido, Raphael, and Tintoretto. Lennier had
been a domestic of Queen Elizabeth, and showed me her head, an intaglio
in a rare sardonyx, cut by a famous Italian, which he assured me was
exceedingly like her.

24th August, 1652. My first child, a son, was born precisely at one
o'clock.

2d September, 1652. Mr. Owen, the sequestered divine, of Eltham,
christened my son by the name of Richard.

22d September, 1652. I went to Woodcott, where Lady Browne was taken with
scarlet fever, and died. She was carried to Deptford, and interred in the
church near Sir Richard's relations with all decent ceremonies, and
according to the church-office, for which I obtained permission, after it
had not been used in that church for seven years. Thus ended an excellent
and virtuous lady, universally lamented, having been so obliging on all
occasions to those who continually frequented her house in Paris, which
was not only an hospital, but an asylum to all our persecuted and
afflicted countrymen, during eleven years' residence there in that
honorable situation.

25th September, 1652. I went to see Dr. Mason's house, so famous for the
prospect (for the house is a wretched one) and description of Barclay's
"_Icon Animarum_."[46]

    [Footnote 46: The book here referred to is in the British Museum,
    entitled "_Joannis Barclaii Icon Animarum_," and printed at London,
    1614, small 12mo. It is written in Latin, and dedicated to Louis
    XIII. of France, for what reason does not appear, the author
    speaking of himself as a subject of this country. It mentions the
    necessity of forming the minds of youth, as a skillful gardener
    forms his trees; the different dispositions of men, in different
    nations; English, Scotch, and Irish, etc. Chapter second contains a
    florid description of the beautiful scenery about Greenwich, but
    does not mention Dr. Mason, or his house.]

5th November, 1652. To London, to visit some friends, but the insolences
were so great in the streets that I could not return till the next day.

Dr. Scarborough was instant with me to give the Tables of Veins and
Arteries to the College of Physicians, pretending he would not only read
upon them, but celebrate my curiosity as being the first who caused them
to be completed in that manner, and with that cost; but I was not so
willing yet to part with them, as to lend them to the College during
their anatomical lectures; which I did accordingly.

22d November, 1652. I went to London, where was proposed to me the
promoting that great work (since accomplished by Dr. Walton, Bishop of
Chester), "_Biblia Polyglotta_," by Mr. Pierson, that most learned
divine.

25th December, 1652. Christmas day, no sermon anywhere, no church being
permitted to be open, so observed it at home. The next day, we went to
Lewisham, where an honest divine preached.

31st December, 1652. I adjusted all accompts, and rendered thanks to
Almighty God for his mercies to me the year past.

[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

1st January, 1652-53. I set apart in preparation for the Blessed
Sacrament, which the next day Mr. Owen administered to me and all my
family in Sayes Court, preaching on John vi. 32, 33, showing the
exceeding benefits of our blessed Savior taking our nature upon him. He
had christened my son and churched my wife in our own house as before
noticed.

17th January, 1653. I began to set out the oval garden at Sayes Court,
which was before a rude orchard, and all the rest one entire field of
100 acres, without any hedge, except the hither holly hedge joining to
the bank of the mount walk. This was the beginning of all the succeeding
gardens, walks, groves, inclosures, and plantations there.

21st January, 1653. I went to London, and sealed some of the writings of
my purchase of Sayes Court.

30th January, 1653. At our own parish church, a stranger preached. There
was now and then an honest orthodox man got into the pulpit, and, though
the present incumbent was somewhat of the Independent, yet he ordinarily
preached sound doctrine, and was a peaceable man; which was an
extraordinary felicity in this age.

1st February, 1653. Old Alexander Rosse (author of "_Virgilius
Evangelizans_," and many other little books) presented me with his book
against Mr. Hobbes's "Leviathan."

19th February, 1653. I planted the orchard at Sayes Court; new moon, wind
west.

22d February, 1653. Was perfected the sealing, livery, and seisin of my
purchase of Sayes Court. My brother, George Glanville, Mr. Scudamore, Mr.
Offley, Co. William Glanville (son to Sergeant Glanville, sometime
Speaker of the House of Commons), Co. Stephens, and several of my friends
dining with me. I had bargained for £3,200, but I paid £3,500.

25th March, 1653. Came to see me that rare graver in _taille-douce_,
Monsieur Richett, he was sent by Cardinal Mazarine to make a collection
of pictures.

11th April, 1653. I went to take the air in Hyde Park, where every coach
was made to pay a shilling, and horse sixpence, by the sordid fellow who
had purchased it of the state, as they called it.

17th May, 1653. My servant Hoare, who wrote those exquisite several
hands, fell of a fit of an apoplexy, caused, as I suppose, by tampering
with mercury about an experiment in gold.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th May, 1653. I went to London, to take my last leave of my honest
friend, Mr. Barton, now dying; it was a great loss to me and to my
affairs. On the sixth of June, I attended his funeral.

8th June, 1653. Came my brother George, Captain Evelyn, the great
traveler, Mr. Muschamp, my cousin, Thomas Keightly, and a virtuoso,
fastastical Simons, who had the talent of embossing so to the life.

9th June, 1653. I went to visit my worthy neighbor, Sir Henry Newton [at
Charlton], and consider the prospect, which is doubtless for city, river,
ships, meadows, hill, woods, and all other amenities, one of the most
noble in the world; so as, had the house running water, it were a
princely seat. Mr. Henshaw and his brother-in-law came to visit me, and
he presented me with a seleniscope.

19th June, 1653. This day, I paid all my debts to a farthing; oh, blessed
day!

21st June, 1653. My Lady Gerrard, and one Esquire Knight, a very rich
gentleman, living in Northamptonshire, visited me.

23d June, 1653. Mr. Lombart, a famous graver, came to see my collections.

27th June, 1653. Monsieur Roupel sent me a small phial of his _aurum
potabile_, with a letter, showing the way of administering it, and the
stupendous cures it had done at Paris; but, ere it came to me, by what
accident I know not, it was all run out.

17th August, 1653. I went to visit Mr. Hyldiard, at his house at Horsley
(formerly the great Sir Walter Raleigh's[47]), where met me Mr. Oughtred,
the famous mathematician; he showed me a box, or golden case, of divers
rich and aromatic balsams, which a chemist, a scholar of his, had sent
him out of Germany.

    [Footnote 47: Evelyn is here in error: Mr. Hyldiard was of East
    Horsley, Sir Walter of West.]

21st August, 1653. I heard that good old man, Mr. Higham, the parson of
the parish of Wotton where I was born, and who had baptized me, preach
after his very plain way on Luke, comparing this troublesome world to the
sea, the ministers to the fishermen, and the saints to the fish.

22d August, 1653. We all went to Guildford, to rejoice at the famous inn,
the Red Lion, and to see the hospital, and the monument of Archbishop
Abbot, the founder, who lies buried in the chapel of his endowment.

28th September, 1653. At Greenwich preached that holy martyr, Dr. Hewer,
on Psalm xc. 11, magnifying the grace of God to penitents, and
threatening the extinction of his Gospel light for the prodigious
impiety of the age.

11th October, 1653. My son, John Stansfield, was born, being my second
child, and christened by the name of my mother's father, that name now
quite extinct, being of Cheshire. Christened by Mr. Owen, in my library,
at Sayes Court, where he afterward churched my wife, I always making use
of him on these occasions, because the parish minister dared not have
officiated according to the form and usage of the Church of England, to
which I always adhered.

25th October, 1653. Mr. Owen preached in my library at Sayes Court on
Luke xviii. 7, 8, an excellent discourse on the unjust judge, showing why
Almighty God would sometimes be compared by such similitudes. He
afterward administered to us all the Holy Sacrament.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

28th October, 1653. Went to London, to visit my Lady Gerrard, where I saw
that cursed woman called the Lady Norton, of whom it was reported that
she spit in our King's face as he went to the scaffold. Indeed, her talk
and discourse was like an impudent woman.

21st November, 1653. I went to London, to speak with Sir John Evelyn, my
kinsman, about the purchase of an estate of Mr. Lambard's at Westeram,
which afterward Sir John himself bought for his son-in-law, Leech.

4th December, 1653. Going this day to our church, I was surprised to see
a tradesman, a mechanic, step up; I was resolved yet to stay and see what
he would make of it. His text was from 2 Sam. xxiii. 20: "And Benaiah
went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of
snow"; the purport was, that no danger was to be thought difficult when
God called for shedding of blood, inferring that now the saints were
called to destroy temporal governments; with such feculent stuff; so
dangerous a crisis were things grown to.

25th December, 1653. Christmas day. No churches, or public assembly. I
was fain to pass the devotions of that Blessed day with my family at
home.

20th January, 1653-54. Come to see my old acquaintance and the most
incomparable player on the Irish harp, Mr. Clark,[48] after his travels.
He was an excellent musician, a discreet gentleman, born in Devonshire
(as I remember). Such music before or since did I never hear, that
instrument being neglected for its extraordinary difficulty; but, in my
judgment, far superior to the lute itself, or whatever speaks with
strings.

    [Footnote 48: See under the year 1688, November.]

25th January, 1654. Died my son, J. Stansfield, of convulsion fits;
buried at Deptford on the east corner of the church, near his mother's
great-grandfather, and other relatives.

8th February, 1654. Ash Wednesday. In contradiction to all custom and
decency, the usurper, Cromwell, feasted at the Lord Mayor's, riding in
triumph through the city.

14th February, 1654. I saw a tame lion play familiarly with a lamb; he
was a huge beast, and I thrust my hand into his mouth and found his
tongue rough like a cat's; a sheep also with six legs, which made use of
five of them to walk; a goose that had four legs, two crops, and as many
vents.

29th March, 1654. That excellent man, Mr. Owen, preached in my library on
Matt. xxviii. 6, a resurrection sermon, and after it we all received the
Holy Communion.

6th April, 1654. Came my Lord Herbert, Sir Kenelm Digby, Mr. Denham, and
other friends to see me.

15th April, 1654. I went to London to hear the famous Jeremy Taylor
(since Bishop of Down and Connor) at St. Gregory's (near St. Paul's) on
Matt. vi, 48, concerning evangelical perfection.

5th May, 1654. I bound my lackey, Thomas Headly, apprentice to a
carpenter, giving with him five pounds and new clothing; he thrived very
well, and became rich.

8th May, 1654. I went to Hackney, to see Lady Brook's garden, which was
one of the neatest and most celebrated in England, the house well
furnished, but a despicable building. Returning, visited one Mr. Tomb's
garden; it has large and noble walks, some modern statues, a vineyard,
planted in strawberry borders, staked at ten feet distances, the
banqueting-house of cedar, where the couch and seats were carved _à
l'antique_; some good pictures in the house, especially one of Vandyke's,
being a man in his shirt; also some of Stenwyck. I also called at Mr.
Ducie's, who has indeed a rare collection of the best masters, and one of
the largest stories of H. Holbein. I also saw Sir Thomas Fowler's
aviary, which is a poor business.

Protestants of Piedmont, 1655. Photogravure from an engraving by Sartain
after Newenham_]

10th May, 1654. My Lady Gerrard treated us at Mulberry Garden, now the
only place of refreshment about the town for persons of the best quality
to be exceedingly cheated at; Cromwell and his partisans having shut up
and seized on Spring Garden, which, till now, had been the usual
rendezvous for the ladies and gallants at this season.

11th May, 1654. I now observed how the women began to paint themselves,
formerly a most ignominious thing, and used only by prostitutes.

14th May, 1654. There being no such thing as church anniversaries in the
parochial assemblies, I was forced to provide at home for Whit Sunday.

15th May, 1654. Came Sir Robert Stapylton, the translator of "Juvenal,"
to visit me.

8th June, 1654. My wife and I set out in a coach and four horses, in our
way to visit relations of hers in Wiltshire, and other parts, where we
resolved to spend some months. We dined at Windsor, saw the Castle and
Chapel of St. George, where they have laid our blessed Martyr, King
Charles, in the VAULT JUST BEFORE THE ALTAR. The church and workmanship
in stone is admirable. The Castle itself is large in circumference; but
the rooms melancholy, and of ancient magnificence. The keep, or mount,
hath, besides its incomparable prospect, a very profound well; and the
terrace toward Eton, with the park, meandering Thames, and sweet meadows,
yield one of the most delightful prospects. That night, we lay at
Reading. Saw my Lord Craven's house at Causam [Caversham], now in ruins,
his goodly woods felling by the Rebels.

9th June, 1654. Dined at Marlborough, which having been lately fired, was
now new built. At one end of this town, we saw my Lord Seymour's house,
but nothing observable save the Mount, to which we ascended by windings
for near half a mile. It seems to have been cast up by hand. We passed by
Colonel Popham's, a noble seat, park, and river. Thence, to Newbury, a
considerable town, and Donnington, famous for its battle, siege, and
castle, this last had been in the possession of old Geoffrey Chaucer.
Then to Aldermaston, a house of Sir Humphrey Forster's, built _à la
moderne_. Also, that exceedingly beautiful seat of my Lord Pembroke, on
the ascent of hill, flanked with wood, and regarding the river, and so,
at night, to Cadenham, the mansion of Edward Hungerford, Esq., uncle to
my wife, where we made some stay. The rest of the week we did nothing but
feast and make good cheer, to welcome my wife.

27th June, 1654. We all went to see Bath, where I bathed in the cross
bath. Among the rest of the idle diversions of the town, one musician was
famous for acting a changeling, which indeed he personated strangely.

The _facciáta_ of this cathedral is remarkable for its historical
carving. The King's Bath is esteemed the fairest in Europe. The town is
entirely built of stone, but the streets narrow, uneven and unpleasant.
Here, we trifled and bathed, and intervisited with the company who
frequent the place for health, till the 30th, and then went to Bristol, a
city emulating London, not for its large extent, but manner of building,
shops, bridge, traffic, exchange, market-place, etc. The governor showed
us the castle, of no great concernment. The city wholly mercantile, as
standing near the famous Severn, commodiously for Ireland, and the
Western world. Here I first saw the manner of refining sugar and casting
it into loaves, where we had a collection of eggs fried in the sugar
furnace, together with excellent Spanish wine. But, what appeared most
stupendous to me, was the rock of St. Vincent, a little distance from the
town, the precipice whereof is equal to anything of that nature I have
seen in the most confragose cataracts of the Alps, the river gliding
between them at an extraordinary depth. Here, we went searching for
diamonds, and to the Hot Wells, at its foot. There is also on the side of
this horrid Alp a very romantic seat: and so we returned to Bath in the
evening, and July 1st to Cadenham.

4th July, 1654. On a letter from my wife's uncle, Mr. Pretyman, I waited
back on her to London, passing by Hungerford, a town famous for its
trouts, and the next day arrived at Deptford, which was 60 miles, in the
extremity of heat.

[Sidenote: OXFORD]

6th July, 1654. I went early to London, and the following day met my wife
and company at Oxford, the eve of the Act.

8th July, 1654. Was spent in hearing several exercises in the schools;
and, after dinner, the Proctor opened the Act at St. Mary's (according to
custom), and the Prevaricators, their drollery. Then, the Doctors
disputed. We supped at Wadham College.

9th July, 1654. Dr. French preached at St. Mary's, on Matt. xii. 42,
advising the students the search after true wisdom, not to be had in the
books of philosophers, but in the Scriptures alone. In the afternoon, the
famous Independent, Dr. Owen, perstringing Episcopacy. He was now
Cromwell's Vice-Chancellor. We dined with Dr. Ward, Mathematical
Professor (since Bishop of Sarum), and at night supped in Baliol College
Hall, where I had once been student and fellow-commoner, and where they
made me extraordinarily welcome.

10th July, 1654. On Monday, I went again to the schools, to hear the
several faculties, and in the afternoon tarried out the whole Act in St.
Mary's, the long speeches of the Proctors, the Vice-Chancellor, the
several Professors, creation of Doctors, by the cap, ring, kiss, etc.,
those ancient ceremonies and institution being as yet not wholly
abolished. Dr. Kendal, now Inceptor among others, performing his Act
incomparably well, concluded it with an excellent oration, abating his
Presbyterian animosities, which he withheld, not even against that
learned and pious divine, Dr. Hammond. The Act was closed with the speech
of the Vice-Chancellor, there being but four in theology, and three in
medicine, which was thought a considerable matter, the times considered.
I dined at one Monsieur Fiat's, a student of Exeter College, and supped
at a magnificent entertainment of Wadham Hall, invited by my dear and
excellent friend, Dr. Wilkins, then Warden (after, Bishop of Chester).

11th July, 1654. Was the Latin sermon, which I could not be at, though
invited, being taken up at All Souls, where we had music, voices, and
theorbos, performed by some ingenious scholars. After dinner, I visited
that miracle of a youth, Mr. Christopher Wren, nephew to the Bishop of
Ely. Then Mr. Barlow (since Bishop of Lincoln), bibliothecarius of the
Bodleian Library, my most learned friend. He showed us the rarities of
that most famous place, manuscripts, medals, and other curiosities. Among
the MSS. an old English Bible, wherein the Eunuch mentioned to be
baptized by Philip, is called the Gelding: "and Philip and the Gelding
went down into the water," etc. The original Acts of the Council of Basil
900 years since, with the _bulla_, or leaden affix, which has a silken
cord passing through every parchment; a MS. of Venerable Bede of 800
years antiquity; the old Ritual _secundum usum Sarum_ exceeding
voluminous; then, among the nicer curiosities, the "Proverbs of Solomon,"
written in French by a lady, every chapter of a several character, or
hand, the most exquisite imaginable; an hieroglyphical table, or carta,
folded up like a map, I suppose it painted on asses' hide, extremely
rare; but, what is most illustrious, there were no less than 1,000 MSS.
in nineteen languages, especially Oriental, furnishing that new part of
the library built by Archbishop Laud, from a design of Sir Kenelm Digby
and the Earl of Pembroke. In the closet of the tower, they show some
Indian weapons, urns, lamps, etc., but the rarest is the whole Alcoran,
written on one large sheet of calico, made up in a priest's vesture, or
cope, after the Turkish and Arabic character, so exquisitely written, as
no printed letter comes near it; also, a roll of magical charms, divers
talismans, and some medals.

Then, I led my wife into the Convocation House, finely wainscoted; the
Divinity School, and Gothic carved roof; the Physic, or Anatomy School,
adorned with some rarities of natural things; but nothing extraordinary
save the skin of a jackal, a rarely-colored jackatoo, or prodigious large
parrot, two humming birds, not much bigger than our bumblebee, which
indeed I had not seen before, that I remember.

12th July, 1654. We went to St. John's, saw the library and the two
skeletons, which are finely cleansed and put together; observable is here
also the store of mathematical instruments, chiefly given by the late
Archbishop Laud, who built here a handsome quadrangle.

Thence we went to New College, where the chapel was in its ancient garb,
notwithstanding the scrupulosity of the times. Thence, to Christ's
Church, in whose library was shown us an Office of Henry VIII., the
writing, miniatures, and gilding whereof is equal, if not surpassing, any
curiosity I had seen of that kind; it was given by their founder,
Cardinal Wolsey. The glass windows of the cathedral (famous in my time)
I found much abused. The ample hall and column, that spreads its capital
to sustain the roof as one goes up the stairs, is very remarkable.

Next we walked to Magdalen College, where we saw the library and chapel,
which was likewise in pontifical order, the altar only I think turned
tablewise, and there was still the double organ, which abominations (as
now esteemed) were almost universally demolished; Mr. Gibbon, that famous
musician, giving us a taste of his skill and talents on that instrument.

Hence, to the Physic Garden, where the sensitive plant was shown us for a
great wonder. There grew canes, olive trees, rhubarb, but no
extraordinary curiosities, besides very good fruit, which, when the
ladies had tasted, we returned in our coach to our lodgings.

13th July, 1654. We all dined at that most obliging and
universally-curious Dr. Wilkins's, at Wadham College. He was the first
who showed me the transparent apiaries, which he had built like castles
and palaces, and so ordered them one upon another, as to take the honey
without destroying the bees. These were adorned with a variety of dials,
little statues, vanes, etc.; and, he was so abundantly civil, finding me
pleased with them, to present me with one of the hives which he had
empty, and which I afterward had in my garden at Sayes Court, where it
continued many years, and which his Majesty came on purpose to see and
contemplate with much satisfaction. He had also contrived a hollow
statue, which gave a voice and uttered words by a long, concealed pipe
that went to its mouth,[49] while one speaks through it at a good
distance. He had, above in his lodgings and gallery, variety of shadows,
dials, perspectives, and many other artificial, mathematical, and magical
curiosities, a waywiser, a thermometer, a monstrous magnet, conic, and
other sections, a balance on a demi-circle; most of them of his own, and
that prodigious young scholar Mr. Christopher Wren, who presented me with
a piece of white marble, which he had stained with a lively red, very
deep, as beautiful as if it had been natural.

    [Footnote 49: Such were the speaking figures long ago exhibited in
    Spring Gardens, and in Leicester Fields.]

Thus satisfied with the civilities of Oxford, we left it, dining at
Farringdon, a town which had been newly fired during the wars; and,
passing near the seat of Sir Walter Pye, we came to Cadenham.

16th July, 1654. We went to another uncle and relative of my wife's, Sir
John Glanville, a famous lawyer, formerly Speaker of the House of
Commons; his seat is at Broad Hinton, where he now lived but in the
gate-house, his very fair dwelling house having been burnt by his own
hands, to prevent the rebels making a garrison of it. Here, my cousin
William Glanville's eldest son showed me such a lock for a door, that for
its filing, and rare contrivances was a masterpiece, yet made by a
country blacksmith. But, we have seen watches made by another with as
much curiosity as the best of that profession can brag of; and, not many
years after, there was nothing more frequent than all sorts of ironwork
more exquisitely wrought and polished than in any part of Europe, so as a
door lock of a tolerable price was esteemed a curiosity even among
foreign princes.

Went back to Cadenham, and, on the 19th, to Sir Edward Baynton's at Spie
Park, a place capable of being made a noble seat; but the humorous old
knight has built a long single house of two low stories on the precipice
of an incomparable prospect, and landing on a bowling-green in the park.
The house is like a long barn, and has not a window on the prospect side.
After dinner, they went to bowls, and, in the meantime, our coachmen were
made so exceedingly drunk, that in returning home we escaped great
dangers. This, it seems, was by order of the knight, that all gentlemen's
servants be so treated; but the custom is barbarous, and much unbecoming
a knight still less a Christian.

[Sidenote: SALISBURY]

20th July, 1654. We proceeded to Salisbury; the cathedral I take to be
the most complete piece of Gothic work in Europe, taken in all its
uniformity. The pillars, reputed to be cast, are of stone manifestly cut
out of the quarry; most observable are those in the chapter house. There
are some remarkable monuments, particularly the ancient Bishops, founders
of the Church, Knights Templars, the Marquis of Hertford's, the cloisters
of the palace and garden, and the great mural dial.

In the afternoon we went to Wilton, a fine house of the Earl of Pembroke,
in which the most observable are the dining room in the modern-built
part toward the garden, richly gilded and painted with story, by De
Crete; also some other apartments, as that of hunting landscapes, by
Pierce; some magnificent chimney-pieces, after the best French manner; a
pair of artificial winding stairs of stone, and divers rare pictures. The
garden, heretofore esteemed the noblest in England, is a large handsome
plain, with a grotto and waterworks, which might be made much more
pleasant, were the river that passes through cleansed and raised; for all
is effected by a mere force. It has a flower garden, not inelegant. But,
after all, that which renders the seat delightful is, its being so near
the downs and noble plains about the country contiguous to it. The
stables are well ordered and yield a graceful front, by reason of the
walks of lime trees, with the court and fountain of the stables adorned
with the Cæsars' heads.

We returned this evening by the plain, and fourteen-mile race, where out
of my lord's hare warren we were entertained with a long course of a hare
for near two miles in sight. Near this, is a _pergola_, or stand, built
to view the sports; and so we came to Salisbury, and saw the most
considerable parts of the city. The market place, with most of the
streets, are watered by a quick current and pure stream running through
the middle of them, but are negligently kept, when with a small charge
they might be purged and rendered infinitely agreeable, and this made one
of the sweetest towns, but now the common buildings are despicable, and
the streets dirty.

22d July, 1654. We departed and dined at a farm of my Uncle Hungerford's,
called Darnford Magna, situated in a valley under the plain, most sweetly
watered, abounding in trouts caught by spear in the night, when they come
attracted by a light set in the stern of a boat.

After dinner, continuing our return, we passed over the goodly plain, or
rather sea of carpet, which I think for evenness, extent, verdure, and
innumerable flocks, to be one of the most delightful prospects in nature,
and reminded me of the pleasant lives of shepherds we read of in
romances.

Now we arrived at Stonehenge, indeed a stupendous monument, appearing at
a distance like a castle; how so many and huge pillars of stone should
have been brought together, some erect, others transverse on the tops of
them, in a circular area as rudely representing a cloister or heathen and
more natural temple, is wonderful. The stone is so exceedingly hard, that
all my strength with a hammer could not break a fragment; which hardness
I impute to their so long exposure. To number them exactly is very
difficult, they lie in such variety of postures and confusion, though
they seemed not to exceed 100; we counted only 95. As to their being
brought thither, there being no navigable river near, is by some admired;
but for the stone, there seems to be the same kind about 20 miles
distant, some of which appear above ground. About the same hills, are
divers mounts raised, conceived to be ancient intrenchments, or places of
burial, after bloody fights. We now went by Devizes, a reasonable large
town, and came late to Cadenham.

27th July, 1654. To the hunting of a sorel deer, and had excellent chase
for four or five hours, but the venison little worth.

29th July, 1654. I went to Langford to see my Cousin Stephens. I also saw
Dryfield, the house heretofore of Sir John Pretyman, grandfather to my
wife, and sold by her uncle; both the seat and house very honorable and
well built, much after the modern fashion.

31st July, 1654. Taking leave of Cadenham, where we had been long and
nobly entertained, we went a compass into Leicestershire, where dwelt
another relation of my wife's; for I indeed made these excursions to show
her the most considerable parts of her native country, who, from her
childhood, had lived altogether in France, as well as for my own
curiosity and information.

[Sidenote: GLOUCESTER]

About two miles before coming to Gloucester, we have a prospect from
woody hills into a most goodly vale and country. Gloucester is a handsome
city, considerable for the church and monuments. The minster is indeed a
noble fabric. The whispering gallery is rare, being through a passage of
twenty-five yards in a many-angled cloister, and was, I suppose, either
to show the skill of the architect, or some invention of a cunning
priest, who, standing unseen in a recess in the middle of the chapel,
might hear whatever was spoken at either end. This is above the choir, in
which lies buried King Stephen[50] under a monument of Irish oak, not ill
carved considering the age. The new library is a noble though a private
design. I was likewise pleased with the Severn gliding so sweetly by it.
The Duke's house, the castle works, are now almost quite dismantled; nor
yet without sad thoughts did I see the town, considering how fatal the
siege had been a few years before to our good King.

    [Footnote 50: King Stephen was buried at Faversham. The effigy
    Evelyn alluded to is that of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy.]

1st August, 1654. We set out toward Worcester, by a way thickly planted
with cider fruit. We deviated to the Holy Wells, trickling out of a
valley through a steep declivity toward the foot of the great Malvern
Hills; they are said to heal many infirmities, as king's evil, leprosy,
sore eyes, etc. Ascending a great height above them to the trench
dividing England from South Wales, we had the prospect of all
Herefordshire, Radnor, Brecknoch, Monmouth, Worcester, Gloucester,
Shropshire, Warwick, Derbyshires, and many more. We could discern
Tewkesbury, King's road, toward Bristol, etc.; so as I esteem it one of
the goodliest vistas in England.

2d August, 1654. This evening we arrived at Worcester, the Judges of
Assize and Sheriff just entering as we did. Viewing the town the next
day, we found the Cathedral much ruined by the late wars, otherwise a
noble structure. The town is neatly paved and very clean, the goodly
river Severn running by it, and standing in a most fertile country.

3d August, 1654. We passed next through Warwick, and saw the castle, the
dwelling house of the Lord Brook, and the furniture noble. It is built on
an eminent rock which gives prospect into a most goodly green, a woody
and plentifully watered country; the river running so delightfully under
it, that it may pass for one of the most surprising seats one should meet
with. The gardens are prettily disposed; but might be much improved. Here
they showed us Sir Guy's great two-handed sword, staff, horse-arms, pot,
and other relics of that famous knight-errant. Warwick is a fair old
town, and hath one church full of ancient monuments.

Having viewed these, I went to visit my worthy friend, Sir H. Puckering,
at the Abbey, and though a melancholy old seat, yet in a rich soil.

Hence to Sir Guy's grot, where they say he did his penances, and died. It
is a squalid den made in the rock, crowned yet with venerable oaks and
looking on a goodly stream, so as, were it improved as it might be, it
were capable of being made a most romantic and pleasant place. Near this,
we were showed his chapel and gigantic statue hewn out of the solid rock,
out of which there are likewise divers other caves cut, and some very
capacious.

The next place to Coventry. The cross is remarkable for Gothic work and
rich gilding, comparable to any I had ever seen, except that of Cheapside
in London, now demolished. This city has many handsome churches, a
beautiful wall, a fair free school and library to it; the streets full of
great shops, clean and well paved. At going forth the gate, they show us
the bone, or rib, of a wild boar, said to have been killed by Sir Guy,
but which I take to be the chine of a whale.

[Sidenote: LEICESTER]

4th August, 1654. Hence, riding through a considerable part of
Leicestershire, an open, rich, but unpleasant country, we came late in
the evening to Horninghold, a seat of my wife's uncle.

7th August, 1654. Went to Uppingham, the shire town of Rutland, pretty
and well built of stone, which is a rarity in that part of England, where
most of the rural parishes are but of mud; and the people living as
wretchedly as in the most impoverished parts of France, which they much
resemble, being idle and sluttish. The country (especially
Leicestershire) much in common; the gentry free drinkers.

9th August, 1654. To the old and ragged city of Leicester, large and
pleasantly seated, but despicably built, the chimney flues like so many
smiths' forges; however, famous for the tomb of the tyrant, Richard III.,
which is now converted to a cistern, at which (I think) cattle drink.
Also, here in one of the churches lies buried the magnificent Cardinal
Wolsey. John of Gaunt has here also built a large but poor hospital, near
which a wretch has made him a house out of the ruins of a stately church.
Saw the ruins of an old Roman Temple, thought to be of Janus. Entertained
at a very fine collection of fruits, such as I did not expect to meet
with so far North, especially very good melons. We returned to my
uncle's.

14th August, 1654. I took a journey into the Northern parts, riding
through Oakham, a pretty town in Rutlandshire, famous for the tenure of
the Barons (Ferrers), who hold it by taking off a shoe from every
nobleman's horse that passes with his lord through the street, unless
redeemed with a certain piece of money. In token of this, are several
gilded shoes nailed up on the castle gate, which seems to have been large
and fair. Hence, we went by Brook, a very sweet seat and park of the old
Lady Camden's. Next, by Burleigh House, belonging to the Duke of
Buckingham, and worthily reckoned among the noblest seats in England,
situate on the brow of a hill, built _à la moderne_ near a park walled
in, and a fine wood at the descent.

Now we were come to Cottsmore, a pretty seat belonging to Mr. Heath, son
of the late Lord Chief Justice of that name. Here, after dinner, parting
with the company that conducted us thus far, I passed that evening by
Belvoir Castle, built on a round mount at the point of a long ridge of
hills, which affords a stately prospect, and is famous for its strenuous
resistance in the late civil war.

Went by Newark-on-Trent, a brave town and garrison. Next, by Wharton
House, belonging to the Lord Chaworth, a handsome seat; then by Home, a
noble place belonging to the Marquis of Dorchester, and passed the famous
river Trent, which divides the South from the North of England; and so
lay that night at Nottingham.

This whole town and county seems to be but one entire rock, as it were,
an exceedingly pleasant shire, full of gentry. Here, I observed divers to
live in the rocks and caves, much after the manner as about Tours, in
France. The church is well built on an eminence; there is a fair house of
the Lord Clare's, another of Pierrepont's; an ample market place; large
streets, full of crosses; the relics of an ancient castle, hollowed
beneath which are many caverns, especially that of the Scots' King, and
his work while there.

This place is remarkable for being the place where his Majesty first
erected his standard at the beginning of our late unhappy differences.
The prospects from this city toward the river and meadows are most
delightful.

15th August, 1654. We passed next through Sherwood Forest, accounted the
most extensive in England. Then, Paplewick, an incomparable vista with
the pretty castle near it. Thence, we saw Newstead Abbey, belonging to
the Lord Byron, situated much like Fontainebleau in France, capable of
being made a noble seat, accommodated as it is with brave woods and
streams; it has yet remaining the front of a glorious abbey church. Next,
by Mansfield town; then Welbeck, the house of the Marquis of Newcastle,
seated in a bottom in a park, and environed with woods, a noble yet
melancholy seat. The palace is a handsome and stately building. Next to
Worksop Abbey, almost demolished; the church has a double flat tower
entire, and a pretty gate. The manor belongs to the Earl of Arundel, and
has to it a fair house at the foot of a hill in a park that affords a
delicate prospect. Tickel, a town and castle, has a very noble prospect.
All these in Nottinghamshire.

16th August, 1654. We arrived at Doncaster, where we lay this night; it
is a large fair town, famous for great wax lights, and good stockings.

17th August, 1654. Passed through Pontefract; the castle famous for many
sieges both of late and ancient times, and the death of that unhappy King
murdered in it (Richard II.), was now demolishing by the Rebels; it
stands on a mount, and makes a goodly show at a distance. The Queen has a
house here, and there are many fair seats near it, especially Mr.
Pierrepont's, built at the foot of a hill out of the castle ruins. We all
alighted in the highway to drink at a crystal spring, which they call
Robin Hood's Well; near it, is a stone chair, and an iron ladle to drink
out of, chained to the seat. We rode to Tadcaster, at the side of which
we have prospect of the Archbishop's Palace (which is a noble seat), and
in sight of divers other gentlemen's fair houses. This tract is a goodly,
fertile, well-watered, and wooded country, abounding with pasture and
plenty of provisions.

[Sidenote: YORK]

To York, the second city of England, fairly walled, of a circular form,
watered by the brave river Ouse, bearing vessels of considerable burden
on it; over it is a stone bridge emulating that of London, and built on;
the middle arch is larger than any I have seen in England, with a wharf
of hewn stone, which makes the river appear very neat. But most
remarkable and worth seeing is St. Peter's Cathedral, which of all the
great churches in England had been best preserved from the fury of the
sacrilegious, by composition with the Rebels when they took the city,
during the many incursions of Scotch and others. It is a most entire
magnificent piece of Gothic architecture. The screen before the choir is
of stone carved with flowers, running work and statues of the old kings.
Many of the monuments are very ancient. Here, as a great rarity in these
days and at this time, they showed me a Bible and Common Prayer Book
covered with crimson velvet, and richly embossed with silver gilt; also a
service for the altar of gilt wrought plate, flagons, basin, ewer,
plates, chalices, patins, etc., with a gorgeous covering for the altar
and pulpit, carefully preserved in the vestry, in the hollow wall whereof
rises a plentiful spring of excellent water. I got up to the tower,
whence we had a prospect toward Durham, and could see Ripon, part of
Lancashire, the famous and fatal Marston Moor, the Spas of Knaresborough,
and all the environs of that admirable country. Sir ---- Ingoldsby has
here a large house, gardens, and tennis court; also the King's house and
church near the castle, which was modernly fortified with a palisade and
bastions. The streets are narrow and ill-paved, the shops like London.

18th August, 1654. We went to Beverley, a large town with two stately
churches, St. John's and St. Mary's, not much inferior to the best of our
cathedrals. Here a very old woman showed us the monuments, and, being
above 100 years of age, spoke the language of Queen Mary's days, in whose
time she was born; she was widow of a sexton who had belonged to the
church a hundred years.

Hence, we passed through a fenny but rich country to Hull, situated like
Calais, modernly and strongly fortified with three block-houses of brick
and earth. It has a good market place and harbor for ships. Famous also
(or rather infamous) is this town for Hotham's refusing entrance to his
Majesty. The water-house is worth seeing. And here ends the south of
Yorkshire.

[Sidenote: LINCOLN]

19th August, 1654. We pass the Humber, an arm of the sea of about two
leagues breadth. The weather was bad, but we crossed it in a good barge
to Barton, the first town in that part of Lincolnshire. All marsh ground
till we came to Brigg, famous for the plantations of licorice, and then
had brave pleasant riding to Lincoln, much resembling Salisbury Plain.
Lincoln is an old confused town, very long, uneven, steep, and ragged;
formerly full of good houses, especially churches and abbeys. The Minster
almost comparable to that of York itself, abounding with marble pillars,
and having a fair front (herein was interred Queen Eleanora, the loyal
and loving wife who sucked the poison out of her husband's wound); the
abbot founder, with rare carving in the stone; the great bell, or Tom, as
they call it. I went up the steeple, from whence is a goodly prospect all
over the country. The soldiers had lately knocked off most of the brasses
from the gravestones, so as few inscriptions were left; they told us that
these men went in with axes and hammers, and shut themselves in, till
they had rent and torn off some barge loads of metal, not sparing even
the monuments of the dead; so hellish an avarice possessed them: beside
which, they exceedingly ruined the city.

Here, I saw a tall woman six feet two inches high, comely, middle-aged,
and well-proportioned, who kept a very neat and clean alehouse, and got
most by people's coming to see her on account of her height.

20th August, 1654. From hence we had a most pleasant ride over a large
heath open like Salisbury Plain, to Grantham, a pretty town, so well
situated on the side of a bottom which is large and at a distance
environed with ascending grounds, that for pleasure I consider it
comparable to most inland places of England; famous is the steeple for
the exceeding height of the shaft, which is of stone.

About eighteen miles south, we pass by a noble seat, and see Boston at a
distance. Here, we came to a parish of which the parson had tithe ale.

Thence through Rutland, we brought night to Horninghold, from whence I
set out on this excursion.

22d August, 1654. I went a setting and hawking, where we had tolerable
sport.

25th August, 1654. To see Kirby, a very noble house of my Lord Hatton's,
in Northamptonshire, built _à la moderne_; the garden and stables
agreeable, but the avenue ungraceful, and the seat naked: returned that
evening.

27th August, 1654. Mr. Allington preached an excellent discourse from
Romans vi. 19. This was he who published those bold sermons of the
members warring against the mind, or the Jews crucifying Christ, applied
to the wicked regicides; for which he was ruined. We had no sermon in the
afternoon.

30th August, 1654. Taking leave of my friends, who had now feasted me
more than a month, I, with my wife, etc., set our faces toward home, and
got this evening to Peterborough, passing by a stately palace (Thorpe) of
St. John's (one deep in the blood of our good king), built out of the
ruins of the Bishop's palace and cloister. The church is exceeding fair,
full of monuments of great antiquity. Here lies Queen Catherine, the
unhappy wife of Henry VIII., and the no less unfortunate Mary, Queen of
Scots. On the steeple, we viewed the fens of Lincolnshire, now much
inclosed and drained with infinite expense, and by many sluices, cuts,
mounds, and ingenious mills, and the like inventions; at which the city
and country about it consisting of a poor and very lazy sort of people,
were much displeased.

Peterborough is a handsome town, and hath another well-built church.

31st August, 1654. Through part of Huntingdonshire, we passed that town,
fair and ancient, a river running by it. The country about it so abounds
in wheat that, when any King of England passes through it, they have a
custom to meet him with a hundred plows.

[Sidenote: CAMBRIDGE]

This evening, to Cambridge; and went first to St. John's College, well
built of brick, and library, which I think is the fairest of that
University. One Mr. Benlowes has given it all the ornaments of _pietra
commessa_,[51] whereof a table and one piece of perspective is very fine;
other trifles there also be of no great value, besides a vast old
song-book, or Service, and some fair manuscripts. There hangs in the
library the picture of John Williams, Archbishop of York, sometime Lord
Keeper, my kinsman, and their great benefactor.

    [Footnote 51: Marble, inlaid of various colors, representing
    flowers, birds, etc.]

Trinity College is said by some to be the fairest quadrangle of any
university in Europe; but in truth is far inferior to that of Christ
Church, in Oxford; the hall is ample and of stone, the fountain in the
quadrangle is graceful, the chapel and library fair. There they showed us
the prophetic manuscript of the famous Grebner, but the passage and
emblem which they would apply to our late King, is manifestly relating to
the Swedish; in truth, it seems to be a mere fantastic rhapsody, however
the title may bespeak strange revelations. There is an office in
manuscript with fine miniatures, and some other antiquities, given by the
Countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VIII., and the before-mentioned
Archbishop Williams, when Bishop of Lincoln. The library is pretty well
stored. The Greek Professor had me into another large quadrangle
cloistered and well built, and gave us a handsome collation in his own
chamber.

Thence to Caius, and afterward to King's College, where I found the
chapel altogether answered expectation, especially the roof, all of
stone, which for the flatness of its laying and carving may, I conceive,
vie with any in Christendom. The contignation of the roof (which I went
upon), weight, and artificial joining of the stones is admirable. The
lights are also very fair. In one aisle lies the famous Dr. Collins, so
celebrated for his fluency in the Latin tongue. From this roof we could
descry Ely, and the encampment of Sturbridge fair now beginning to set up
their tents and booths; also Royston, Newmarket, etc., houses belonging
to the King. The library is too narrow.

Clare-Hall is of a new and noble design, but not finished.

Peter-House, formerly under the government of my worthy friend, Dr.
Joseph Cosin, Dean of Peterborough; a pretty neat college, having a
delicate chapel. Next to Sidney, a fine college.

Catherine-Hall, though a mean structure, is yet famous for the learned
Bishop Andrews, once Master. Emanuel College, that zealous house, where
to the hall they have a parlor for the Fellows. The chapel is reformed,
_ab origine_, built north and south, and meanly erected, as is the
library.

Jesus-College, one of the best built, but in a melancholy situation. Next
to Christ-College, a very noble erection, especially the modern part,
built without the quadrangle toward the gardens, of exact architecture.

The Schools are very despicable, and Public Library but mean, though
somewhat improved by the wainscoting and books lately added by the Bishop
Bancroft's library and MSS. They showed us little of antiquity, only King
James's Works, being his own gift, and kept very reverently.

The market place is very ample, and remarkable for old Hobson, the
pleasant carrier's beneficence of a fountain.[52] But the whole town is
situate in a low, dirty, unpleasant place, the streets ill-paved, the air
thick and infected by the fens, nor are its churches, (of which St.
Mary's is the best) anything considerable in compare to Oxford.[53]

    [Footnote 52: A conduit it should rather be called.]

    [Footnote 53: The reader must remember that an Oxford man is
    speaking.]

From Cambridge, we went to Audley-End, and spent some time in seeing that
goodly place built by Howard, Earl of Suffolk, once Lord Treasurer. It is
a mixed fabric, between antique and modern, but observable for its being
completely finished, and without comparison is one of the stateliest
palaces in the kingdom. It consists of two courts, the first very large,
winged with cloisters. The front had a double entrance; the hall is fair,
but somewhat too small for so august a pile. The kitchen is very large,
as are the cellars, arched with stone, very neat and well disposed; these
offices are joined by a wing out of the way very handsomely. The gallery
is the most cheerful and I think one of the best in England; a fair
dining-room, and the rest of the lodgings answerable, with a pretty
chapel. The gardens are not in order, though well inclosed. It has also a
bowling-alley, a noble well-walled, wooded and watered park, full of fine
_collines_ and ponds: the river glides before the palace, to which is an
avenue of lime trees, but all this is much diminished by its being placed
in an obscure bottom. For the rest, is a perfectly uniform structure, and
shows without like a diadem, by the decorations of the cupolas and other
ornaments on the pavilions; instead of rails and balusters, there is a
border of capital letters, as was lately also on Suffolk-House, near
Charing-Cross, built by the same Lord Treasurer.

This house stands in the parish of Saffron Walden, famous for the
abundance of saffron there cultivated, and esteemed the best of any
foreign country.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d October, 1654. Having dined here, we passed through Bishop Stortford,
a pretty watered town, and so by London, late home to Sayes Court, after
a journey of 700 miles, but for the variety an agreeable refreshment
after my turmoil and building.

10th October, 1654. To my brother at Wotton, who had been sick.

14th October, 1654. I went to visit my noble friend Mr. Hyldiard, where I
met that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, and Dr. Stokes, one of his
Majesty's chaplains.

15th October, 1654. To Betchworth Castle, to Sir Ambrose Browne, and
other gentlemen of my sweet and native country.

24th October, 1654. The good old parson, Higham, preached at Wotton
Church: a plain preacher, but innocent and honest man.

23d November, 1654. I went to London, to visit my cousin Fanshawe, and
this day I saw one of the rarest collections of agates, onyxes, and
intaglios, that I had ever seen either at home or abroad, collected by a
conceited old hatmaker in Blackfriars, especially one agate vase,
heretofore the great Earl of Leicester's.

28th November, 1654. Came Lady Langham, a kinswoman of mine, to visit us;
also one Captain Cooke, esteemed the best singer, after the Italian
manner, of any in England; he entertained us with his voice and theorbo.

30th November, 1654. My birthday, being the 34th year of my age: blessing
God for his providence, I went to London to visit my brother.

3d December, 1654. Advent Sunday. There being no Office at the church but
extemporary prayers after the Presbyterian way, for now all forms were
prohibited, and most of the preachers were usurpers, I seldom went to
church upon solemn feasts; but, either went to London, where some of the
orthodox sequestered divines did privately use the Common Prayer,
administer sacraments, etc., or else I procured one to officiate in my
house; wherefore, on the 10th, Dr. Richard Owen, the sequestered minister
of Eltham, preached to my family in my library, and gave us the Holy
Communion.

25th December, 1654. Christmas day. No public offices in churches, but
penalties on observers, so as I was constrained to celebrate it at home.

1st January, 1654-55. Having with my family performed the public offices
of the day, and begged a blessing on the year I was now entering, I went
to keep the rest of Christmas at my brother's, R. Evelyn, at Woodcot.

19th January, 1655. My wife was brought to bed of another son, being my
third, but second living. Christened on the 26th by the name of John.

28th January, 1655. A stranger preached from Colossians iii. 2, inciting
our affections to the obtaining heavenly things. I understood afterward
that this man had been both chaplain and lieutenant to Admiral Penn,
using both swords; whether ordained or not I cannot say; into such times
were we fallen!

24th February, 1655. I was showed a table clock whose balance was only a
crystal ball, sliding on parallel wires, without being at all fixed, but
rolling from stage to stage till falling on a spring concealed from
sight, it was thrown up to the utmost channel again, made with an
imperceptible declivity, in this continual vicissitude of motion prettily
entertaining the eye every half minute, and the next half giving progress
to the hand that showed the hour, and giving notice by a small bell, so
as in 120 half minutes, or periods of the bullet's falling on the
ejaculatory spring, the clock part struck. This very extraordinary piece
(richly adorned) had been presented by some German prince to our late
king, and was now in the possession of the usurper; valued at £200.

2d March, 1655. Mr. Simpson, the King's jeweler, showed me a most rich
agate cup, of an escalop-shape, and having a figure of Cleopatra at the
scroll, her body, hair, mantle, and veil, of the several natural colors.
It was supported by a half Mark Antony, the colors rarely natural, and
the work truly antique, but I conceived they were of several pieces; had
they been all of one stone, it were invaluable.

18th March, 1655. Went to London, on purpose to hear that excellent
preacher, Dr. Jeremy Taylor, on Matt. xiv. 17, showing what were the
conditions of obtaining eternal life; also, concerning abatements for
unavoidable infirmities, how cast on the accounts of the cross. On the
31st, I made a visit to Dr. Jeremy Taylor, to confer with him about some
spiritual matters, using him thenceforward as my ghostly father. I
beseech God Almighty to make me ever mindful of, and thankful for, his
heavenly assistances!

2d April, 1655. This was the first week, that, my uncle Pretyman being
parted with his family from me, I began housekeeping, till now sojourning
with him in my own house.

9th April, 1655. I went to see the great ship newly built by the usurper,
Oliver, carrying ninety-six brass guns, and 1,000 tons burden. In the
prow was Oliver on horseback, trampling six nations under foot, a Scot,
Irishman, Dutchman, Frenchman, Spaniard, and English, as was easily made
out by their several habits. A Fame held a laurel over his insulting
head; the word, GOD WITH US.

15th April, 1655. I went to London with my family, to celebrate the feast
of Easter. Dr. Wild preached at St. Gregory's; the ruling Powers
conniving at the use of the Liturgy, etc., in the church alone. In the
afternoon, Mr. Pierson (since Bishop of Chester) preached at Eastcheap,
but was disturbed by an alarm of fire, which about this time was very
frequent in the city.

29th May, 1655. I sold Preston to Colonel Morley.

17th June, 1655. There was a collection for the persecuted churches and
Christians in Savoy, remnants of the ancient Albigenses.

3d July, 1655. I was shown a pretty Terella, described with all the
circles, and showing all the magnetic deviations.

14th July, 1655. Came Mr. Pratt, my old acquaintance at Rome, also Sir
Edward Hales, Sir Joseph Tufton, with Mr. Seymour.

1st August, 1655. I went to Dorking, to see Mr. Charles Howard's
amphitheater, garden, or solitary recess, being fifteen acres environed
by a hill. He showed us divers rare plants, caves, and an elaboratory.

[Sidenote: ALBURY]

10th August, 1655. To Albury, to visit Mr. Howard, who had begun to
build, and alter the gardens much. He showed me many rare pictures,
particularly the Moor on horseback; Erasmus, as big as the life, by
Holbein; a Madonna, in miniature, by Oliver; but, above all, the skull,
carved in wood, by Albert Durer, for which his father was offered £100;
also Albert's head, by himself, with divers rare agates, intaglios, and
other curiosities.

21st August, 1655. I went to Ryegate, to visit Mrs. Cary, at my Lady
Peterborough's, in an ancient monastery well in repair, but the park much
defaced; the house is nobly furnished. The chimney-piece in the great
chamber, carved in wood, was of Henry VIII., and was taken from a house
of his in Bletchingley. At Ryegate, was now the Archbishop of Armagh, the
learned James Usher, whom I went to visit. He received me exceeding
kindly. In discourse with him, he told me how great the loss of time was
to study much the Eastern languages; that, excepting Hebrew, there was
little fruit to be gathered of exceeding labor; that, besides some
mathematical books, the Arabic itself had little considerable; that the
best text was the Hebrew Bible; that the Septuagint was finished in
seventy days, but full of errors, about which he was then writing; that
St. Hierome's was to be valued next the Hebrew; also that the seventy
translated the Pentateuch only, the rest was finished by others; that the
Italians at present understood but little Greek, and Kircher was a
mountebank; that Mr. Selden's best book was his "Titles of Honor"; that
the church would be destroyed by sectaries, who would in all likelihood
bring in Popery. In conclusion he recommended to me the study of
philology, above all human studies; and so, with his blessing, I took my
leave of this excellent person, and returned to Wotton.

27th August, 1655. I went to Boxhill, to see those rare natural bowers,
cabinets, and shady walks in the box copses: hence we walked to
Mickleham, and saw Sir F. Stidolph's seat, environed with elm trees and
walnuts innumerable, and of which last he told us they received a
considerable revenue. Here are such goodly walks and hills shaded with
yew and box, as render the place extremely agreeable, it seeming from
these evergreens to be summer all the winter.

28th August, 1655. Came that renowned mathematician, Mr. Oughtred, to see
me, I sending my coach to bring him to Wotton, being now very aged. Among
other discourse, he told me he thought water to be the philosopher's
first matter, and that he was well persuaded of the possibility of their
elixir; he believed the sun to be a material fire, the moon a continent,
as appears by the late selenographers; he had strong apprehensions of
some extraordinary event to happen the following year, from the
calculation of coincidence with the diluvian period; and added that it
might possibly be to convert the Jews by our Savior's visible appearance,
or to judge the world; and therefore, his word was, "_Parate in
occursum_"; he said original sin was not met with in the Greek Fathers,
yet he believed the thing; this was from some discourse on Dr. Taylor's
late book, which I had lent him.

16th September, 1655. Preached at St. Gregory's one Darnel, on Psalm iv.
4, concerning the benefit of self-examination; more learning in SO SHORT
A TIME AS AN HOUR I have seldom heard.

17th September, 1655. Received £2,600 of Mr. Hurt, for the Manor of
Warley Magna, in Essex, purchased by me some time since. The taxes were
so intolerable that they ate up the rents, etc., surcharged as that
county had been above all others during our unnatural war.

19th September, 1655. Came to see me Sir Edward Hales, Mr. Ashmole, Mr.
Harlakenton, and Mr. Thornhill: and, the next day, I visited Sir Henry
Newton at Charlton, where I met the Earl of Winchelsea and Lady
Beauchamp, daughter to the Lord Capel.

On Sunday afternoon, I frequently staid at home to catechize and instruct
my family, those exercises universally ceasing in the parish churches, so
as people had no principles, and grew very ignorant of even the common
points of Christianity; all devotion being now placed in hearing sermons
and discourses of speculative and national things.

26th September, 1655. I went to see Colonel Blount's subterranean warren,
and drank of the wine of his vineyard, which was good for little.

30th September, 1655. Sir Nicholas Crisp came to treat with me about his
vast design of a mole to be made for ships in part of my grounds at Sayes
Court.

3d November, 1655. I had accidentally discourse with a Persian and a
Greek concerning the devastation of Poland by the late incursion of the
Swedes.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1655. To London about Sir Nicholas Crisp's designs.

I went to see York House and gardens, belonging to the former great
Buckingham, but now much ruined through neglect.

Thence, to visit honest and learned Mr. Hartlib, a public spirited and
ingenious person, who had propagated many useful things and arts. He told
me of the castles which they set for ornament on their stoves in Germany
(he himself being a Lithuanian, as I remember), which are furnished with
small ordnance of silver on the battlements, out of which they discharge
excellent perfumes about the rooms, charging them with a little powder to
set them on fire, and disperse the smoke: and in truth no more than need,
for their stoves are sufficiently nasty. He told me of an ink that would
give a dozen copies, moist sheets of paper being pressed on it; and
remain perfect; and a receipt how to take off any print without the least
injury to the original. This gentleman was master of innumerable
curiosities, and very communicative. I returned home that evening by
water; and was afflicted for it with a cold that had almost killed me.

This day, came forth the Protector's Edict, or Proclamation, prohibiting
all ministers of the Church of England from preaching or teaching any
schools, in which he imitated the apostate, Julian; with the decimation
of all the royal party's revenues throughout England.

14th December, 1655. I visited Mr. Hobbes, the famous philosopher of
Malmesbury, with whom I had been long acquainted in France.

Now were the Jews admitted.

25th December, 1655. There was no more notice taken of Christmas-day in
churches.

I went to London, where Dr. Wild preached the funeral sermon of
Preaching, this being the last day; after which Cromwell's proclamation
was to take place, that none of the Church of England should dare either
to preach, or administer Sacraments, teach schools, etc., on pain of
imprisonment, or exile. So this was the most mournful day that in my life
I had seen, or the Church of England herself, since the Reformation; to
the great rejoicing of both Papist and Presbyter.[54] So pathetic was
his discourse, that it drew many tears from the auditory. Myself, wife,
and some of our family, received the Communion, God make me thankful, who
hath hitherto provided for us the food of our souls as well as bodies!
The Lord Jesus pity our distressed Church, and bring back the captivity
of Zion!

    [Footnote 54: The text was 2 Cor. xiii 9. That, however persecution
    dealt with the Ministers of God's Word, they were still to pray for
    the flock, and wish their perfection, as it was the flock to pray
    for and assist their pastors, by the example of St. Paul.--EVELYN'S
    NOTE.]

5th January, 1655-56. Came to visit me my Lord Lisle, son to the Earl of
Leicester, with Sir Charles Ouseley, two of the Usurper's council; Mr.
John Hervey, and John Denham, the poet.

18th January, 1656. Went to Eltham on foot, being a great frost, but a
mist falling as I returned, gave me such a rheum as kept me within doors
near a whole month after.

5th February, 1656. Was shown me a pretty perspective and well
represented in a triangular box, the great Church of Haarlem in Holland,
to be seen through a small hole at one of the corners, and contrived into
a handsome cabinet. It was so rarely done, that all the artists and
painters in town flocked to see and admire it.

10th February, 1656. I heard Dr. Wilkins preach before the Lord Mayor in
St. Paul's, showing how obedience was preferable to sacrifice. He was a
most obliging person, who had married the Protector's sister, and took
great pains to preserve the Universities from the ignorant, sacrilegious
commanders and soldiers, who would fain have demolished all places and
persons that pretended to learning.

11th February, 1656. I ventured to go to Whitehall, where of many years I
had not been, and found it very glorious and well furnished, as far as I
could safely go, and was glad to find they had not much defaced that rare
piece of Henry VII., etc., done on the walls of the King's privy chamber.

14th February, 1656. I dined with Mr. Berkeley, son of Lord Berkeley, of
Berkeley Castle, where I renewed my acquaintance with my Lord Bruce, my
fellow-traveler in Italy.

19th February, 1656. Went with Dr. Wilkins to see Barlow, the famous
painter of fowls, beasts, and birds.

4th March, 1656. This night I was invited by Mr. Roger L'Estrange to hear
the incomparable Lubicer on the violin. His variety on a few notes and
plain ground, with that wonderful dexterity, was admirable. Though a
young man, yet so perfect and skillful, that there was nothing, however
cross and perplexed, brought to him by our artists, which he did not play
off at sight with ravishing sweetness and improvements, to the
astonishment of our best masters. In sum, he played on the single
instrument a full concert, so as the rest flung down their instruments,
acknowledging the victory. As to my own particular, I stand to this hour
amazed that God should give so great perfection to so young a person.
There were at that time as excellent in their profession as any were
thought to be in Europe, Paul Wheeler, Mr. Mell, and others, till this
prodigy appeared. I can no longer question the effects we read of in
David's harp to charm evil spirits, or what is said some particular notes
produced in the passions of Alexander, and that King of Denmark.

12th April, 1656. Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Robert Boyle (that excellent
person and great virtuoso), Dr. Taylor, and Dr. Wilkins, dined with me at
Sayes Court, when I presented Dr. Wilkins with my rare burning-glass. In
the afternoon, we all went to Colonel Blount's, to see his newly-invented
plows.

22d April, 1656. Came to see Mr. Henshaw and Sir William Paston's son,
since Earl of Yarmouth. Afterward, I went to see his Majesty's house at
Eltham, both palace and chapel in miserable ruins, the noble woods and
park destroyed by Rich, the rebel.

6th May, 1656. I brought Monsieur le Franc, a young French Sorbonnist, a
proselyte, to converse with Dr. Taylor; they fell to dispute on original
sin, in Latin, upon a book newly published by the Doctor, who was much
satisfied with the young man. Thence, to see Mr. Dugdale, our learned
antiquary and herald. Returning, I was shown the three vast volumes of
Father Kircher's, "_Obeliscus Pamphilius_" and "_Ægyptiacus_"; in the
second volume I found the hieroglyphic I first communicated and sent to
him at Rome by the hands of Mr. Henshaw, whom he mentions; I designed it
from the stone itself brought me to Venice from Cairo by Captain Powell.

7th May, 1656. I visited Dr. Taylor, and prevailed on him to propose
Monsieur le Franc to the Bishop that he might have Orders, I having
sometime before brought him to a full consent to the Church of England,
her doctrine and discipline, in which he had till of late made some
difficulty; so he was this day ordained both deacon and priest by the
Bishop of Meath. I paid the fees to his lordship, who was very poor and
in great want; to that necessity were our clergy reduced! In the
afternoon I met Alderman Robinson, to treat with Mr. Papillion about the
marriage of my cousin, George Tuke, with Mrs. Fontaine.

8th May, 1656. I went to visit Dr. Wilkins, at Whitehall, when I first
met with Sir P. Neal, famous for his optic glasses. Greatorix, the
mathematical instrument maker, showed me his excellent invention to
quench fire.

12th May, 1656. Was published my "Essay on Lucretius," with innumerable
errata by the negligence of Mr. Triplet, who undertook the correction of
the press in my absence. Little of the Epicurean philosophy was then
known among us.

28th May, 1656. I dined with Nieuport, the Holland Ambassador, who
received me with extraordinary courtesy. I found him a judicious, crafty,
and wise man. He gave me excellent cautions as to the danger of the
times, and the circumstances our nation was in. I remember the
observation he made upon the ill success of our former Parliaments, and
their private animosities, and little care of the public.

Came to visit me the old Marquis of Argyle (since executed), Lord
Lothian, and some other Scotch noblemen, all strangers to me. Note, the
Marquis took the turtle-doves in the aviary for owls.

The Earl of Southampton (since Treasurer) and Mr. Spencer, brother to the
Earl of Sunderland, came to see my garden.

7th July, 1656. I began my journey to see some parts of the northeast of
England; but the weather was so excessively hot and dusty, I shortened my
progress.

8th July, 1656. To Colchester, a fair town, but now wretchedly demolished
by the late siege, especially the suburbs, which were all burned, but
were then repairing. The town is built on a rising ground, having fair
meadows on one side, and a river with a strong ancient castle, said to
have been built by King Coilus, father of Helena, mother of Constantine
the Great, of whom I find no memory save at the pinnacle of one of their
wool-staple houses, where is a statue of Coilus, in wood, wretchedly
carved. The walls are exceedingly strong, deeply trenched, and filled
with earth. It has six gates, and some watchtowers, and some handsome
churches. But what was shown us as a kind of miracle, at the outside of
the Castle, the wall where Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, those
valiant and noble persons who so bravely behaved themselves in the last
siege, were barbarously shot, murdered by Ireton in cold blood, after
surrendering on articles; having been disappointed of relief from the
Scotch army, which had been defeated with the King at Worcester. The
place was bare of grass for a large space, all the rest of it abounding
with herbage. For the rest, this is a ragged and factious town, now
swarming with sectaries. Their trading is in cloth with the Dutch, and
baize and says with Spain; it is the only place in England where these
stuffs are made unsophisticated. It is also famous for oysters and eringo
root, growing hereabout, and candied for sale.

Went to Dedham, a pretty country town, having a very fair church, finely
situated, the valley well watered. Here, I met with Dr. Stokes, a young
gentleman, but an excellent mathematician. This is a clothing town, as
most are in Essex, but lies in the unwholesome hundreds.

Hence to Ipswich, doubtless one of the sweetest, most pleasant,
well-built towns in England. It has twelve fair churches, many noble
houses, especially the Lord Devereux's; a brave quay, and commodious
harbor, being about seven miles from the main; an ample market place.
Here was born the great Cardinal Wolsey, who began a palace here, which
was not finished.

I had the curiosity to visit some Quakers here in prison; a new fanatic
sect, of dangerous principles, who show no respect to any man,
magistrate, or other, and seem a melancholy, proud sort of people, and
exceedingly ignorant. One of these was said to have fasted twenty days;
but another, endeavoring to do the like, perished on the 10th, when he
would have eaten, but could not.

10th July, 1656. I returned homeward, passing again through Colchester;
and, by the way, near the ancient town of Chelmsford, saw New Hall, built
in a park by Henry VII. and VIII., and given by Queen Elizabeth to the
Earl of Sussex, who sold it to the late great Duke of Buckingham, and
since seized on by Oliver Cromwell (pretended Protector). It is a fair
old house, built with brick, low, being only of two stories, as the
manner then was; the gate-house better; the court, large and pretty; the
staircase, of extraordinary wideness, with a piece representing Sir
Francis Drake's action in the year 1580, an excellent sea-piece; the
galleries are trifling; the hall is noble; the garden a fair plot, and
the whole seat well accommodated with water; but, above all, I admired
the fair avenue planted with stately lime trees, in four rows, for near a
mile in length. It has three descents, which is the only fault, and may
be reformed. There is another fair walk of the same at the mall and
wilderness, with a tennis-court, and pleasant terrace toward the park,
which was well stored with deer and ponds.

11th July, 1656. Came home by Greenwich ferry, where I saw Sir J.
Winter's project of charring sea-coal, to burn out the sulphur, and
render it sweet. He did it by burning the coals in such earthen pots as
the glass men melt their metal, so firing them without consuming them,
using a bar of iron in each crucible, or pot, which bar has a hook at one
end, that so the coals being melted in a furnace with other crude
sea-coals under them, may be drawn out of the pots sticking to the iron,
whence they are beaten off in great half-exhausted cinders, which being
rekindled, make a clear, pleasant chamber-fire, deprived of their sulphur
and arsenic malignity. What success it may have, time will discover.[55]

    [Footnote 55: Many years ago, Lord Dundonald revived the project,
    with the proposed improvement of extracting and saving the tar.
    Unfortunately he did not profit by it. The coal thus charred is sold
    as COKE, a very useful fuel for many purposes.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d August, 1656. I went to London, to receive the Blessed Sacrament, the
first time the Church of England was reduced to a chamber and
conventicle; so sharp was the persecution. The parish churches were
filled with sectaries of all sorts, blasphemous and ignorant mechanics
usurping the pulpits everywhere. Dr. Wild preached in a private house in
Fleet Street, where we had a great meeting of zealous Christians, who
were generally much more devout and religious than in our greatest
prosperity. In the afternoon, I went to the French Church in the Savoy,
where I heard Monsieur d'Espagne catechize, and so returned to my house.

20th August, 1656. Was a confused election of Parliament called by the
Usurper.

7th September, 1656. I went to take leave of my excellent neighbor and
friend, Sir. H. Newton and lady, now going to dwell at Warwick; and Mr.
Needham, my dear and learned friend, came to visit me.

14th September, 1656. Now was old Sir Henry Vane[56] sent to Carisbrook
Castle, in Wight, for a foolish book he published; the pretended
Protector fortifying himself exceedingly, and sending many to prison.

    [Footnote 56: Evelyn means the younger Vane. This was "Vane, young
    in years, but in sage counsel old," the nobleness and independence
    of whose character, as well as his claims to the affection of
    posterity, are not ill expressed in the two facts recorded by
    Evelyn--his imprisonment by Cromwell, and his judicial murder by
    Charles II. The foolish book to which Evelyn refers was an able and
    fearless attack on Cromwell's government.]

2d October, 1656. Came to visit me my cousin, Stephens, and Mr. Pierce
(since head of Magdalen College, Oxford), a learned minister of Brington,
in Northamptonshire, and Captain Cooke, both excellent musicians.

2d November, 1656. There was now nothing practical preached, or that
pressed reformation of life, but high and speculative points and strains
that few understood, which left people very ignorant, and of no steady
principles, the source of all our sects and divisions, for there was much
envy and uncharity in the world; God of his mercy amend it! Now, indeed,
that I went at all to church, while these usurpers possessed the pulpits,
was that I might not be suspected for a Papist, and that, though the
minister was Presbyterianly affected, he yet was as I understood duly
ordained, and preached sound doctrine after their way, and besides was an
humble, harmless, and peaceable man.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th December, 1656. I went to London, to receive the Blessed Communion,
this holy festival at Dr. Wild's lodgings, where I rejoiced to find so
full an assembly of devout and sober Christians.

26th December, 1656. I invited some of my neighbors and tenants,
according to custom, and to preserve hospitality and charity.

28th December, 1656. A stranger preached on Luke xviii. 7, 8, on which he
made a confused discourse, with a great deal of Greek and ostentation of
learning, to but little purpose.

30th December, 1656. Dined with me Sir William Paston's son, Mr. Henshaw,
and Mr. Clayton.

31st December, 1656. I begged God's blessing and mercies for his goodness
to me the past year, and set my domestic affairs in order.

1st January, 1656-57. Having prayed with my family, and celebrated the
anniversary, I spent some time in imploring God's blessing the year I was
entered into.

7th January, 1657. Came Mr. Matthew Wren (since secretary to the Duke),
slain in the Dutch war, eldest son to the Bishop of Ely, now a prisoner
in the Tower; a most worthy and honored gentleman.

10th January, 1657. Came Dr. Joyliffe, that famous physician and
anatomist, first detector of the lymphatic veins; also the old Marquis of
Argyle, and another Scotch Earl.

5th February, 1657. Dined at the Holland Ambassador's; he told me the
East India Company of Holland had constantly a stock of £400,000 in
India, and forty-eight men-of-war there: he spoke of their exact and just
keeping their books and correspondence, so as no adventurer's stock could
possibly be lost, or defeated; that it was a vulgar error that the
Hollanders furnished their enemies with powder and ammunition for their
money, though engaged in a cruel war, but that they used to merchandise
indifferently, and were permitted to sell to the friends of their
enemies. He laughed at our Committee of Trade, as composed of men wholly
ignorant of it, and how they were the ruin of commerce, by gratifying
some for private ends.

10th February, 1657. I went to visit the governor of Havannah, a brave,
sober, valiant Spanish gentleman, taken by Captain Young, of Deptford,
when, after twenty years being in the Indies, and amassing great wealth,
his lady and whole family, except two sons, were burned, destroyed, and
taken within sight of Spain, his eldest son, daughter, and wife,
perishing with immense treasure. One son, of about seventeen years old,
with his brother of one year old, were the only ones saved. The young
gentleman, about seventeen, was a well-complexioned youth, not
olive-colored; he spoke Latin handsomely, was extremely well-bred, and
born in the Caraccas, 1,000 miles south of the equinoctial, near the
mountains of Potosi; he had never been in Europe before. The Governor was
an ancient gentleman of great courage, of the order of St. Jago, sorely
wounded in his arm, and his ribs broken; he lost for his own share
£100,000 sterling, which he seemed to bear with exceeding indifference,
and nothing dejected. After some discourse, I went with them to Arundel
House, where they dined. They were now going back into Spain, having
obtained their liberty from Cromwell. An example of human vicissitude!

[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th February, 1657. To London, where I found Mrs. Cary; next day came Mr.
Mordaunt (since Viscount Mordaunt), younger son to the Countess of
Peterborough, to see his mistress, bringing with him two of my Lord of
Dover's daughters: so, after dinner, they all departed.

5th March, 1657. Dr. Rand, a learned physician, dedicated to me his
version of Gassendi's "_Vita Peiriskii_."

25th March, 1657. Dr. Taylor showed me his MS. of "Cases of Conscience,"
or "_Ductor Dubitantium_," now fitted for the press.

The Protector Oliver, now affecting kingship, is petitioned to take the
title on him by all his newly-made sycophant lords, etc.; but dares not,
for fear of the fanatics, not thoroughly purged out of his rebel army.

21st April, 1657. Came Sir Thomas Hanmer, of Hanmer, in Wales, to see me.
I then waited on my Lord Hatton, with whom I dined: at my return, I
stepped into Bedlam, where I saw several poor, miserable creatures in
chains; one of them was mad with making verses. I also visited the
Charter House, formerly belonging to the Carthusians, now an old, neat,
fresh, solitary college for decayed gentlemen. It has a grove, bowling
green, garden, chapel, and a hall where they eat in common. I likewise
saw Christ Church and Hospital, a very good Gothic building; the hall,
school, and lodgings in great order for bringing up many hundreds of poor
children of both sexes; it is an exemplary charity. There is a large
picture at one end of the hall, representing the governors, founders, and
the institution.

25th April, 1657. I had a dangerous fall out of the coach in Covent
Garden, going to my brother's, but without harm; the Lord be praised!

1st May, 1657. Divers soldiers were quartered at my house; but I thank
God went away the next day toward Flanders.

5th May, 1657. I went with my cousin, George Tuke, to see Baynard, in
Surrey, a house of my brother Richard's, which he would have hired. This
is a very fair, noble residence, built in a park, and having one of the
goodliest avenues of oaks up to it that ever I saw: there is a pond of 60
acres near it; the windows of the chief rooms are of very fine painted
glass. The situation is excessively dirty and melancholy.

15th May, 1657. Lawrence, President of Oliver's Council, and some other
of his Court-Lords, came in the afternoon to see my garden and
plantations.

7th June, 1657. My fourth son was born, christened George (after my
grandfather); Dr. Jeremy Taylor officiated in the drawing-room.

18th June, 1657. At Greenwich I saw a sort of cat[57] brought from the
East Indies, shaped and snouted much like the Egyptian racoon, in the
body like a monkey, and so footed; the ears and tail like a cat, only the
tail much longer, and the skin variously ringed with black and white;
with the tail it wound up its body like a serpent, and so got up into
trees, and with it would wrap its whole body round. Its hair was woolly
like a lamb; it was exceedingly nimble, gentle, and purred as does the
cat.

    [Footnote 57: This was probably the animal called a Mocock
    (_maucaco_), since well known.]

16th July, 1657. On Dr. Jeremy Taylor's recommendation, I went to Eltham,
to help one Moody, a young man, to that living, by my interest with the
patron.

6th August, 1657. I went to see Colonel Blount, who showed me the
application of the waywiser[58] to a coach, exactly measuring the miles,
and showing them by an index as we went on. It had three circles, one
pointing to the number of rods, another to the miles, by 10 to 1,000,
with all the subdivisions of quarters; very pretty and useful.

    [Footnote 58: Beckmann, in his "History of Inventions," has written
    an account of the different instruments applied to carriages to
    measure the distance they pass over. He places the first
    introduction of the _adometer_ in England at about the end of the
    seventeenth century, instead of about the middle, and states it to
    have been the invention of an ingenious artist named Butterfield.]

10th August, 1657. Our vicar, from John xviii. 36, declaimed against the
folly of a sort of enthusiasts and desperate zealots, called the
FIFTH-MONARCHY-MEN, pretending to set up the kingdom of Christ with the
sword. To this pass was this age arrived when we had no King in Israel.

21st August, 1657. Fell a most prodigious rain in London, and the year
was very sickly in the country.

1st September, 1657. I visited Sir Edmund Bowyer, at his melancholy seat
at Camberwell. He has a very pretty grove of oaks, and hedges of yew in
his garden, and a handsome row of tall elms before his court.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th September, 1657. Going to London with some company, we stepped in to
see a famous rope-dancer, called THE TURK. I saw even to astonishment the
agility with which he performed. He walked barefooted, taking hold by his
toes only of a rope almost perpendicular, and without so much as touching
it with his hands; he danced blind-fold on the high rope, and with a boy
of twelve years old tied to one of his feet about twenty feet beneath
him, dangling as he danced, yet he moved as nimbly as if it had been but
a feather. Lastly, he stood on his head, on the top of a very high mast,
danced on a small rope that was very slack, and finally flew down the
perpendicular, on his breast, his head foremost, his legs and arms
extended, with divers other activities.--I saw the hairy woman, twenty
years old, whom I had before seen when a child. She was born at Augsburg,
in Germany. Her very eyebrows were combed upward, and all her _forehead_
as thick and even as grows on any woman's head, neatly dressed; a very
long lock of hair out of each ear; she had also a most prolix beard, and
_moustachios_, with long locks growing on the middle of her nose, like an
Iceland dog exactly, the color of a bright brown, fine as well-dressed
flax. She was now married, and told me she had one child that was not
hairy, nor were any of her parents, or relations. She was very well
shaped, and played well on the harpsichord.

17th September, 1657. To see Sir Robert Needham, at Lambeth, a relation
of mine; and thence to John Tradescant's museum, in which the chiefest
rarities were, in my opinion, the ancient Roman, Indian, and other
nations' armor, shields, and weapons; some habits of curiously-colored
and wrought feathers, one from the phoenix wing, as tradition goes.
Other innumerable things there were printed in his catalogue by Mr.
Ashmole, to whom after the death of the widow they are bequeathed, and by
him designed as a gift to Oxford.

19th October, 1657. I went to see divers gardens about London: returning,
I saw at Dr. Joyliffe's two Virginian rattlesnakes alive, exceeding a
yard in length, small heads, slender tails, but in the middle nearly the
size of my leg; when vexed, swiftly vibrating and shaking their tails, as
loud as a child's rattle; this, by the collision of certain gristly skins
curiously jointed, yet loose, and transparent as parchment, by which they
give warning; a providential caution for other creatures to avoid them.
The Doctor tried their biting on rats and mice, which they immediately
killed: but their vigor must needs be much exhausted here, in another
climate, and kept only in a barrel of bran.

22d October, 1657. To town, to visit the Holland Ambassador, with whom I
had now contracted much friendly correspondence, useful to the
intelligence I constantly gave his Majesty abroad.

26th November, 1657. I went to London, to a court of the East India
Company on its new union, in Merchant-Taylors' Hall, where was much
disorder by reason of the Anabaptists, who would have the adventurers
obliged only by an engagement, without swearing, that they still might
pursue their private trade; but it was carried against them. Wednesday
was fixed on for a general court for election of officers, after a sermon
and prayers for good success. The Stock resolved on was £800,000.

27th November, 1657. I took the oath at the East India House, subscribing
£500.

2d December, 1657. Dr. Raynolds (since Bishop of Norwich) preached before
the company at St. Andrew Under-shaft, on Nehemiah xiii. 31, showing, by
the example of Nehemiah, all the perfections of a trusty person in
public affairs, with many good precepts apposite to the occasion, ending
with a prayer for God's blessing on the company and the undertaking.

3d December, 1657. Mr. Gunning preached on John iii. 3, against the
Anabaptists, showing the effect and necessity of the sacrament of
baptism. This sect was now wonderfully spread.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th December, 1657. I went to London with my wife, to celebrate
Christmas-day, Mr. Gunning preaching in Exeter chapel, on Micah vii. 2.
Sermon ended, as he was giving us the Holy Sacrament, the chapel was
surrounded with soldiers, and all the communicants and assembly surprised
and kept prisoners by them, some in the house, others carried away. It
fell to my share to be confined to a room in the house, where yet I was
permitted to dine with the master of it, the Countess of Dorset, Lady
Hatton, and some others of quality who invited me. In the afternoon, came
Colonel Whalley, Goffe, and others, from Whitehall, to examine us one by
one; some they committed to the marshal, some to prison. When I came
before them, they took my name and abode, examined me why, contrary to
the ordinance made, that none should any longer observe the superstitious
time of the nativity (so esteemed by them), I durst offend, and
particularly be at common prayers, which they told me was but the mass in
English, and particularly pray for Charles Stuart; for which we had no
Scripture. I told them we did not pray for Charles Stuart, but for all
Christian kings, princes, and governors. They replied, in so doing we
prayed for the king of Spain, too, who was their enemy and a Papist, with
other frivolous and ensnaring questions, and much threatening; and,
finding no color to detain me, they dismissed me with much pity of my
ignorance. These were men of high flight and above ordinances, and spoke
spiteful things of our Lord's nativity. As we went up to receive the
Sacrament, the miscreants held their muskets against us, as if they would
have shot us at the altar; but yet suffering us to finish the office of
Communion, as perhaps not having instructions what to do, in case they
found us in that action. So I got home late the next day; blessed be God!

27th January, 1657-58. After six fits of a quartan ague, with which it
pleased God to visit him, died my dear son, Richard, to our
inexpressible grief and affliction, five years and three days old only,
but at that tender age a prodigy for wit and understanding; for beauty of
body, a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and rare hopes.
To give only a little taste of them, and thereby glory to God, who "out
of the mouths of babes and infants does sometimes perfect his praises,"
he had learned all his catechism; at two years and a half old, he could
perfectly read any of the English, Latin, French, or Gothic letters,
pronouncing the first three languages exactly. He had, before the fifth
year, or in that year, not only skill to read most written hands, but to
decline all the nouns, conjugate the verbs regular, and most of the
irregular; learned out "Puerilis," got by heart almost the entire
vocabulary of Latin and French primitives and words, could make congruous
syntax, turn English into Latin, and _vice versâ_, construe and prove
what he read, and did the government and use of relatives, verbs,
substantives, ellipses, and many figures and tropes, and made a
considerable progress in Comenius's "_Janua_"; began himself to write
legibly, and had a strong passion for Greek. The number of verses he
could recite was prodigious, and what he remembered of the parts of
plays, which he would also act; and, when seeing a Plautus in one's hand,
he asked what book it was, and, being told it was comedy, and too
difficult for him, he wept for sorrow. Strange was his apt and ingenious
application of fables and morals; for he had read Æsop; he had a
wonderful disposition to mathematics, having by heart divers propositions
of Euclid that were read to him in play, and he would make lines and
demonstrate them. As to his piety, astonishing were his applications of
Scripture upon occasion, and his sense of God; he had learned all his
catechism early, and understood the historical part of the Bible and New
Testament to a wonder, how Christ came to redeem mankind, and how,
comprehending these necessaries himself, his godfathers were discharged
of their promise.

These and the like illuminations, far exceeding his age and experience,
considering the prettiness of his address and behavior, cannot but leave
impressions in me at the memory of him. When one told him how many days a
Quaker had fasted, he replied that was no wonder; for Christ had said
that man should not live by bread alone, but by the Word of God. He would
of himself select the most pathetic psalms, and chapters out of Job, to
read to his maid during his sickness, telling her, when she pitied him,
that all God's children must suffer affliction. He declaimed against the
vanities of the world, before he had seen any. Often he would desire
those who came to see him to pray by him, and a year before he fell sick,
to kneel and pray with him alone in some corner. How thankfully would he
receive admonition! how soon be reconciled! how indifferent, yet
continually cheerful! He would give grave advice to his brother, John,
bear with his impertinences, and say he was but a child. If he heard of
or saw any new thing, he was unquiet till he was told how it was made; he
brought to us all such difficulties as he found in books, to be
expounded. He had learned by heart divers sentences in Latin and Greek,
which, on occasion, he would produce even to wonder. He was all life, all
prettiness, far from morose, sullen, or childish in anything he said or
did. The last time he had been at church (which was at Greenwich), I
asked him, according to custom, what he remembered of the sermon; two
good things, Father, said he, _bonum gratiæ_ and _bonum gloriæ_, with a
just account of what the preacher said.

The day before he died, he called to me: and in a more serious manner
than usual, told me that for all I loved him so dearly I should give my
house, land, and all my fine things to his brother Jack, he should have
none of them; and, the next morning, when he found himself ill, and that
I persuaded him to keep his hands in bed, he demanded whether he might
pray to God with his hands unjoined; and a little after, while in great
agony, whether he should not offend God by using his holy name so often
calling for ease. What shall I say of his frequent pathetical
ejaculations uttered of himself: "Sweet Jesus, save me, deliver me,
pardon my sins, let thine angels receive me!" So early knowledge, so much
piety and perfection! But thus God, having dressed up a saint fit for
himself, would not longer permit him with us, unworthy of the future
fruits of this incomparable hopeful blossom. Such a Child I never saw:
for such a child I bless God, in whose bosom he is! May I and mine
become as this little child, who now follows the child Jesus that Lamb of
God in a white robe, whithersoever he goes; even so, Lord Jesus, _fiat
voluntas tua_! Thou gavest him to us, thou hast taken him from us,
blessed be the name of the Lord! That I had anything acceptable to thee
was from thy grace alone, seeing from me he had nothing but sin, but that
thou hast pardoned! blessed be my God for ever, Amen.

In my opinion, he was suffocated by the women and maids that attended
him, and covered him too hot with blankets as he lay in a cradle, near an
excessive hot fire in a close room. I suffered him to be opened, when
they found that he was what is vulgarly called liver-grown. I caused his
body to be coffined in lead, and deposited on the 30th at eight o'clock
that night in the church at Deptford, accompanied with divers of my
relations and neighbors, among whom I distributed rings with this motto:
"_Dominus abstulit_;" intending, God willing, to have him transported
with my own body to be interred in our dormitory in Wotton Church, in my
dear native county of Surrey, and to lay my bones and mingle my dust with
my fathers, if God be gracious to me, and make me as fit for him as this
blessed child was. The Lord Jesus sanctify this and all other my
afflictions, Amen.

Here ends the joy of my life, and for which I go even mourning to the
grave.

15th February, 1658. The afflicting hand of God being still upon us, it
pleased him also to take away from us this morning my youngest son,
George, now seven weeks languishing at nurse, breeding teeth, and ending
in a dropsy. God's holy will be done! He was buried in Deptford Church,
the 17th following.

25th February, 1658. Came Dr. Jeremy Taylor, and my brothers, with other
friends, to visit and condole with us.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th March, 1658. To London, to hear Dr. Taylor in a private house on Luke
xiii. 23, 24. After the sermon, followed the blessed Communion, of which
I participated. In the afternoon, Dr. Gunning, at Exeter House,
expounding part of the Creed.

This had been the severest winter that any man alive had known in
England. The crows' feet were frozen to their prey. Islands of ice
inclosed both fish and fowl frozen, and some persons in their boats.

15th May, 1658, was a public fast, to avert an epidemical sickness, very
mortal this spring.

20th May, 1658. I went to see a coach race in Hyde Park, and collationed
in Spring Garden.

23d May, 1658. Dr. Manton, the famous Presbyterian, preached at Covent
Garden, on Matthew vi. 10, showing what the kingdom of God was, how pray
for it, etc.

There was now a collection for persecuted and sequestered Ministers of
the Church of England, whereof divers are in prison. A sad day! The
Church now in dens and caves of the earth.

31st May, 1658. I went to visit my Lady Peterborough, whose son, Mr.
Mordaunt, prisoner in the Tower, was now on his trial, and acquitted but
by one voice; but that holy martyr, Dr. Hewer, was condemned to die
without law, jury, or justice, but by a mock Council of State, as they
called it. A dangerous, treacherous time!

2d June, 1658. An extraordinary storm of hail and rain, the season as
cold as winter, the wind northerly near six months.

3d June, 1658. A large whale was taken between my land abutting on the
Thames and Greenwich, which drew an infinite concourse to see it, by
water, horse, coach, and on foot, from London, and all parts. It appeared
first below Greenwich at low water, for at high water it would have
destroyed all the boats, but lying now in shallow water encompassed with
boats, after a long conflict, it was killed with a harping iron, struck
in the head, out of which spouted blood and water by two tunnels; and
after a horrid groan, it ran quite on shore, and died. Its length was
fifty-eight feet, height sixteen; black skinned, like coach leather; very
small eyes, great tail, only two small fins, a peaked snout and a mouth
so wide, that divers men might have stood upright in it; no teeth, but
sucked the slime only as through a grate of that bone which we call
whalebone; the throat yet so narrow, as would not have admitted the least
of fishes. The extremes of the cetaceous bones hang downward from the
upper jaw, and are hairy toward the ends and bottom within side: all of
it prodigious; but in nothing more wonderful than that an animal of so
great a bulk should be nourished only by slime through those grates.

8th June, 1658. That excellent preacher and holy man, Dr. Hewer, was
martyred for having intelligence with his Majesty, through the Lord
Marquis of Ormond.

9th June, 1658. I went to see the Earl of Northumberland's pictures,
whereof that of the Venetian Senators was one of the best of Titian's and
another of Andrea del Sarto, viz, a Madonna, Christ, St. John, and an Old
Woman; a St. Catherine of Da Vinci, with divers portraits of Vandyck; a
Nativity of Georgioni; the last of our blessed Kings (Charles I.), and
the Duke of York, by Lely, a Rosary by the famous Jesuits of Brussels,
and several more. This was in Suffolk House: the new front toward the
gardens is tolerable, were it not drowned by a too massy and clumsy pair
of stairs of stone, without any neat invention.

10th June, 1658. I went to see the Medical Garden at Westminster, well
stored with plants, under Morgan, a very skillful botanist.

26th June, 1658. To Eltham, to visit honest Mr. Owen.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d July, 1658. To London, and dined with Mr. Henshaw, Mr. Dorell, and Mr.
Ashmole, founder of the Oxford repository of rarities, with divers
doctors of physic and virtuosos.

15th July, 1658. Came to see my Lord Kilmurry and Lady, Sir Robert
Needham, Mr. Offley, and two daughters of my Lord Willoughby, of Parham.

3d August, 1658. Went to Sir John Evelyn at Godstone. The place is
excellent, but might be improved by turning some offices of the house,
and removing the garden. The house being a noble fabric, though not
comparable to what was first built by my uncle, who was master of all the
powder mills.

5th August, 1658. We went to Squirries to visit my Cousin Leech, daughter
to Sir John; a pretty, finely wooded, well watered seat, the stables
good, the house old, but convenient. 6th. Returned to Wotton.

10th August, 1658. I dined at Mr. Carew Raleigh's, at Horsley, son to the
famous Sir Walter.

14th August, 1658. We went to Durdans [at Epsom] to a challenged match at
bowls for £10, which we won.

18th August, 1658. To Sir Ambrose Browne, at Betchworth Castle, in that
tempestuous wind which threw down my greatest trees at Sayes Court, and
did so much mischief all over England. It continued the whole night;
and, till three in the afternoon of the next day, in the southwest, and
destroyed all our winter fruit.

3d September, 1658. Died that arch-rebel, Oliver Cromwell, called
Protector.

16th September, 1658. Was published my translation of St. Chrysostom on
"Education of Children," which I dedicated to both my brothers to comfort
them on the loss of their children.

21st September, 1658. My Lord Berkeley, of Berkeley Castle, invited me to
dinner.

26th September, 1658. Mr. King preached at Ashted, on Proverbs xv. 24; a
Quaker would have disputed with him. In the afternoon, we heard Dr.
Hacket (since Bishop of Litchfield) at Cheam, where the family of the
Lumleys lie buried.

27th September, 1658. To Beddington, that ancient seat of the Carews, a
fine old hall, but a scambling house, famous for the first orange garden
in England, being now overgrown trees, planted in the ground, and secured
in winter with a wooden tabernacle and stoves. This seat is rarely
watered, lying low, and environed with good pastures. The pomegranates
bear here. To the house is also added a fine park. Thence, to Carshalton,
excellently watered, and capable of being made a most delicious seat,
being on the sweet downs, and a champaign about it full planted with
walnut and cherry trees, which afford a considerable rent.

Riding over these downs, and discoursing with the shepherds, I found that
digging about the bottom near Sir Christopher Buckle's,[59] near
Banstead, divers medals have been found, both copper and silver, with
foundations of houses, urns, etc. Here, indeed, anciently stood a city of
the Romans. See Antonine's "Itineraries."

    [Footnote 59: Not far from the course of the Roman Road from
    Chichester, through Sussex, passing through Ockley, and Dorking
    churchyard. Considerable remains of a Roman building have since been
    found on Waltonheath, south of this house.]

29th September, 1658. I returned home, after a ten weeks' absence.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1658. I went to London, to receive the Holy Sacrament.

On the 3d, Dr. Wild preached in a private place on Isaiah i. 4, showing
the parallel between the sins of Israel and those of England. In the
afternoon, Mr. Hall (son to Joseph, Bishop of Norwich) on 1 Cor. vi. 2,
of the dignity of the Saints; a most excellent discourse.

4th October, 1658. I dined with the Holland ambassador, at Derby House:
returning, I diverted to see a very WHITE RAVEN, bred in Cumberland; also
a porcupine, of that kind that shoots its quills, of which see Claudian;
it was headed like a rat, the fore feet like a badger, the hind feet like
a bear.

19th October, 1658. I was summoned to London, by the commissioners for
new buildings; afterward, to the commission of sewers; but because there
was an oath to be taken of fidelity to the Government as now constituted
without a king, I got to be excused, and returned home.

22d October, 1658. Saw the superb funeral of the protector. He was
carried from Somerset House in a velvet bed of state, drawn by six
horses, housed with the same; the pall held by his new lords; Oliver
lying in effigy, in royal robes, and crowned with a crown, sceptre, and
globe, like a king. The pendants and guidons were carried by the officers
of the army; the imperial banners, achievements, etc., by the heralds in
their coats; a rich caparisoned horse, embroidered all over with gold; a
knight of honor, armed _cap-a-pie_, and, after all, his guards, soldiers,
and innumerable mourners. In this equipage, they proceeded to
Westminster: but it was the most joyful funeral I ever saw; for there
were none that cried but dogs, which the soldiers hooted away with a
barbarous noise, drinking and taking tobacco in the streets as they went.

I returned not home till the 17th of November.

I was summoned again to London by the commissioners for new foundations
to be erected within such a distance of London.

6th December, 1658. Now was published my "French Gardener," the first and
best of the kind that introduced the use of the olitory garden to any
purpose.

23d December, 1658. I went with my wife to keep Christmas at my cousin,
George Tuke's, at Cressing Temple, in Essex. Lay that night at Brentwood.

25th December, 1658. Here was no public service, but what we privately
used. I blessed God for his mercies the year past; and 1st of January,
begged a continuance of them. Thus, for three Sundays, by reason of the
incumbent's death, here was neither praying nor preaching, though there
was a chapel in the house.

17th January, 1659. Our old vicar preached, taking leave of the parish in
a pathetical speech, to go to a living in the city.

24th March, 1659. I went to London, to speak to the patron, Alderman
Cuttler, about presenting a fit pastor for our destitute parish church.

5th April, 1659. Came the Earl of Northampton and the famous painter, Mr.
Wright, to visit me.

10th April, 1659. One Mr. Littler, being now presented to the living of
our parish, preached on John vi. 55, a sermon preparatory to the Holy
Sacrament.

25th April, 1659. A wonderful and sudden change in the face of the
public; the new protector, Richard, slighted; several pretenders and
parties strive for the government: all anarchy and confusion; Lord have
mercy on us!

5th May, 1659. I went to visit my brother in London; and next day, to see
a new opera, after the Italian way, in recitative music and scenes, much
inferior to the Italian composure and magnificence; but it was prodigious
that in a time of such public consternation such a vanity should be kept
up, or permitted. I, being engaged with company, could not decently
resist the going to see it, though my heart smote me for it.

7th May, 1659. Came the Ambassador of Holland and his lady to visit me,
and stayed the whole afternoon.

12th May, 1659. I returned the visit, discoursing much of the
revolutions, etc.

19th May, 1659. Came to dine with me my Lord Galloway and his son, a
Scotch Lord and learned: also my brother and his lady, Lord Berkeley and
his lady, Mrs. Shirley, and the famous singer, Mrs. Knight,[60] and other
friends.

    [Footnote 60: Afterward one of Charles II.'s mistresses.]

23d May, 1659. I went to Rookwood, and dined with Sir William Hicks,
where was a great feast and much company. It is a melancholy old house,
environed with trees and rooks.

26th May, 1659. Came to see me my Lord George Berkeley, Sir William
Ducie, and Sir George Pott's son of Norfolk.

29th May, 1659. The nation was now in extreme confusion and unsettled,
between the Armies and the Sectaries, the poor Church of England
breathing as it were her last; so sad a face of things had overspread us.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th June, 1659. To London, to take leave of my brother, and see the
foundations now laying for a long street and buildings in Hatton Garden,
designed for a little town, lately an ample garden.

1st September, 1659. I communicated to Mr. Robert Boyle, son to the Earl
of Cork, my proposal for erecting a philosophic and mathematic college.

15th September, 1659. Came to see me Mr. Brereton,[61] a very learned
gentleman, son to my Lord Brereton, with his and divers other ladies.
Also, Henry Howard of Norfolk, since Duke of Norfolk.

    [Footnote 61: William, afterward third Lord Brereton; an
    accomplished and able man, who assisted Evelyn in establishing the
    Royal Society. He died in 1679.]

30th September, 1659. I went to visit Sir William Ducie and Colonel
Blount, where I met Sir Henry Blount, the famous traveler and water
drinker.

10th October, 1659. I came with my wife and family to London: took
lodgings at the Three Feathers, in Russell Street, Covent Garden, for the
winter, my son being very unwell.

11th October, 1659. Came to visit me Mr. William Coventry (since
secretary to the Duke), son to the Lord Keeper, a wise and witty
gentleman.

The Army now turned out the Parliament. We had now no government in the
nation: all in confusion; no magistrate either owned or pretended; but
the soldiers, and they not agreed. God Almighty have mercy on us, and
settle us!

17th October, 1659. I visited Mr. Howard, at Arundel House, who gave me a
fair onyx set in gold, and showed me his design of a palace there.

21st October, 1659. A private fast was kept by the Church of England
Protestants in town, to beg of God the removal of his judgments, with
devout prayers for his mercy to our calamitous Church.

7th November, 1659. Was published my bold "Apology for the King" in this
time of danger, when it was capital to speak or write in favor of him. It
was twice printed; so universally it took.

9th November, 1659. We observed our solemn Fast for the calamity of our
Church.

12th November, 1659. I went to see the several drugs for the confection
of treacle, dioscordium, and other electuaries, which an ingenious
apothecary had not only prepared and ranged on a large and very long
table, but covered every ingredient with a sheet of paper, on which was
very lively painted the thing in miniature, well to the life, were it
plant, flower, animal, or other exotic drug.

15th November, 1659. Dined with the Dutch Ambassador. He did in a manner
acknowledge that his nation mind only their own profit, do nothing out of
gratitude, but collaterally as it relates to their gain, or security; and
therefore the English were to look for nothing of assistance to the
banished King. This was to me no very grateful discourse, though an
ingenuous confession.

18th November, 1659. Mr. Gunning celebrated the wonted Fast, and preached
on Phil. ii. 12, 13.

24th November, 1659. Sir John Evelyn [of Godstone] invited us to the
forty-first wedding-day feast, where was much company of friends.

26th November, 1659. I was introduced into the acquaintance of divers
learned and worthy persons, Sir John Marsham, Mr. Dugdale, Mr. Stanley,
and others.

9th December, 1659. I supped with Mr. Gunning, it being our fast day, Dr.
Fearne, Mr. Thrisco, Mr. Chamberlain, Dr. Henchman, Dr. Wild, and other
devout and learned divines, firm confessors, and excellent persons. Note:
Most of them since made bishops.

10th December, 1659. I treated privately with Colonel Morley, then
Lieutenant of the Tower, and in great trust and power, concerning
delivering it to the King, and the bringing of him in, to the great
hazard of my life, but the Colonel had been my schoolfellow, and I knew
would not betray me.

12th December, 1659. I spent in public concerns for his Majesty, pursuing
the point to bring over Colonel Morley, and his brother-in-law, Fay,
Governor of Portsmouth.

18th December, 1659. Preached that famous divine, Dr. Sanderson (since
Bishop of Lincoln), now eighty years old, on Jer. xxx. 13, concerning the
evil of forsaking God.

29th December, 1659. Came my Lord Count Arundel, of Wardour, to visit me.
I went also to see my Lord Viscount Montague.

31st December, 1659. Settling my domestic affairs in order, blessed God
for his infinite mercies and preservations the past year.

ANNUS MIRABILIS, January 1st, 1659-60. Begging God's blessings for the
following year, I went to Exeter Chapel, when Mr. Gunning began the year
on Galatians iv. 3-7, showing the love of Christ in shedding his blood so
early for us.

12th January, 1660. Wrote to Colonel Morley again to declare for his
Majesty.

22d January, 1660. I went this afternoon to visit Colonel Morley. After
dinner I discoursed with him; but he was very jealous, and would not
believe that Monk came in to do the King any service; I told him that he
might do it without him, and have all the honor. He was still doubtful,
and would resolve on nothing yet, so I took leave.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d February, 1660. Kept the Fast. General Monk came now to London out of
Scotland; but no man knew what he would do or declare; yet he was met on
his way by the gentlemen of all the counties which he passed with
petitions that he would recall the old long-interrupted Parliament, and
settle the nation in some order, being at this time in most prodigious
confusion, and under no government, everybody expecting what would be
next and what he would do.

10th February, 1660. Now were the gates of the city broken down by
General Monk; which exceedingly exasperated the city, the soldiers
marching up and down as triumphing over it, and all the old army of the
fanatics put out of their posts and sent out of town.

11th February, 1660. A signal day. Monk, perceiving how infamous and
wretched a pack of knaves would have still usurped the supreme power, and
having intelligence that they intended to take away his commission,
repenting of what he had done to the city, and where he and his forces
were quartered, marches to Whitehall, dissipates that nest of robbers,
and convenes the old Parliament, the Rump Parliament (so called as
retaining some few rotten members of the other) being dissolved; and for
joy whereof were many thousands of rumps roasted publicly in the streets
at the bonfires this night, with ringing of bells, and universal jubilee.
This was the first good omen.

From 17th February to 5th April, I was detained in bed with a kind of
double tertian, the cruel effects of the spleen and other distempers, in
that extremity that my physicians, Drs. Wetherborn, Needham, and Claude,
were in great doubt of my recovery; but it pleased God to deliver me out
of this affliction, for which I render him hearty thanks: going to church
the 8th, and receiving the blessed eucharist.

During this sickness came divers of my relations and friends to visit me,
and it retarded my going into the country longer than I intended;
however, I wrote and printed a letter in defense of his Majesty,[62]
against a wicked forged paper, pretended to be sent from Brussels to
defame his Majesty's person and virtues and render him odious, now when
everybody was in hope and expectation of the General and Parliament
recalling him, and establishing the Government on its ancient and right
basis. The doing this toward the decline of my sickness, and sitting up
long in my bed, had caused a small relapse, out of which it yet pleased
God also to free me, so as by the 14th I was able to go into the country,
which I did to my sweet and native air at Wotton.

    [Footnote 62: With the title of "The Late News, or Message from
    Brussels Unmasked." This, and the pamphlet which gave rise to it,
    are reprinted in "Evelyn's Miscellaneous Writings."]

3d May, 1660. Came the most happy tidings of his Majesty's gracious
declaration and applications to the Parliament, General, and people, and
their dutiful acceptance and acknowledgment, after a most bloody and
unreasonable rebellion of near twenty years. Praised be forever the Lord
of Heaven, who only doeth wondrous things, because his mercy endureth
forever.

8th May, 1660. This day was his Majesty proclaimed in London, etc.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th May, 1660. I was desired and designed to accompany my Lord Berkeley
with the public address of the Parliament, General, etc., to the King,
and invite him to come over and assume his Kingly Government, he being
now at Breda; but I was yet so weak, I could not make that journey by
sea, which was not a little to my detriment, so I went to London to
excuse myself, returning the 10th, having yet received a gracious message
from his Majesty by Major Scot and Colonel Tuke.

24th May, 1660. Came to me Colonel Morley, about procuring his pardon,
now too late, seeing his error and neglect of the counsel I gave him, by
which, if he had taken it he had certainly done the great work with the
same ease that Monk did it, who was then in Scotland, and Morley in a
post to have done what he pleased, but his jealousy and fear kept him
from that blessing and honor. I addressed him to Lord Mordaunt, then in
great favor, for his pardon, which he obtained at the cost of £1,000, as
I heard. Oh, the sottish omission of this gentleman! what did I not
undergo of danger in this negotiation, to have brought him over to his
Majesty's interest, when it was entirely in his hands!

29th May, 1660. This day, his Majesty, Charles II. came to London, after
a sad and long exile and calamitous suffering both of the King and
Church, being seventeen years. This was also his birthday, and with a
triumph of above 20,000 horse and foot, brandishing their swords, and
shouting with inexpressible joy; the ways strewn with flowers, the bells
ringing, the streets hung with tapestry, fountains running with wine; the
Mayor, Aldermen, and all the companies, in their liveries, chains of
gold, and banners; Lords and Nobles, clad in cloth of silver, gold, and
velvet; the windows and balconies, all set with ladies; trumpets, music,
and myriads of people flocking, even so far as from Rochester, so as they
were seven hours in passing the city, even from two in the afternoon till
nine at night.

I stood in the Strand and beheld it, and blessed God. And all this was
done without one drop of blood shed, and by that very army which rebelled
against him: but it was the Lord's doing, for such a restoration was
never mentioned in any history, ancient or modern, since the return of
the Jews from their Babylonish captivity; nor so joyful a day and so
bright ever seen in this nation, this happening when to expect or effect
it was past all human policy.

4th June, 1660. I received letters of Sir Richard Browne's landing at
Dover, and also letters from the Queen, which I was to deliver at
Whitehall, not as yet presenting myself to his Majesty, by reason of the
infinite concourse of people. The eagerness of men, women, and children,
to see his Majesty, and kiss his hands, was so great, that he had scarce
leisure to eat for some days, coming as they did from all parts of the
nation; and the King being as willing to give them that satisfaction,
would have none kept out, but gave free access to all sorts of people.

Addressing myself to the Duke, I was carried to his Majesty, when very
few noblemen were with him, and kissed his hands, being very graciously
received. I then returned home, to meet Sir Richard Browne, who came not
till the 8th, after nineteen years exile, during all which time he kept
up in his chapel the Liturgy and Offices of the Church of England, to his
no small honor, and in a time when it was so low, and as many thought
utterly lost, that in various controversies both with Papists and
Sectaries, our divines used to argue for the visibility of the Church,
from his chapel and congregation.

I was all this week to and fro at court about business.

16th June, 1660. The French, Italian, and Dutch Ministers came to make
their address to his Majesty, one Monsieur Stoope pronouncing the
harangue with great eloquence.

18th June, 1660. I proposed the embassy to Constantinople for Mr.
Henshaw; but my Lord Winchelsea struck in.

Goods that had been pillaged from Whitehall during the Rebellion were now
daily brought in, and restored upon proclamation; as plate, hangings,
pictures, etc.

22d June, 1660. The Warwickshire gentlemen (as did all the shires and
chief towns in all the three nations) presented their congratulatory
address. It was carried by my Lord Northampton.

30th June, 1660. The Sussex gentlemen presented their address, to which
was my hand. I went with it, and kissed his Majesty's hand, who was
pleased to own me more particularly by calling me his old acquaintance,
and speaking very graciously to me.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d July, 1660. I went to Hyde Park, where was his Majesty, and abundance
of gallantry.

4th July, 1660. I heard Sir Samuel Tuke harangue to the House of Lords,
in behalf of the Roman Catholics, and his account of the transaction at
Colchester in murdering Lord Capel, and the rest of those brave men, that
suffered in cold blood, after articles of rendition.

5th July, 1660. I saw his Majesty go with as much pomp and splendor as
any earthly prince could do to the great city feast, the first they had
invited him to since his return; but the exceeding rain which fell all
that day much eclipsed its lustres. This was at Guildhall, and there was
also all the Parliament men, both Lords and Commons. The streets were
adorned with pageants, at immense cost.

6th July, 1660. His Majesty began first to TOUCH FOR THE EVIL! according
to custom, thus: his Majesty sitting under his state in the banqueting
house, the chirurgeons cause the sick to be brought, or led, up to the
throne, where they kneeling, the King strokes their faces, or cheeks with
both his hands at once, at which instant a chaplain in his formalities
says, "He put his hands upon them, and he healed them." This is said to
every one in particular. When they have all been touched, they come up
again in the same order, and the other chaplain kneeling, and having
angel gold[63] strung on white ribbon on his arm, delivers them one by
one to his Majesty, who puts them about the necks of the touched as they
pass, while the first chaplain repeats, "That is the true light who came
into the world." Then follows, an Epistle (as at first a Gospel) with the
Liturgy, prayers for the sick, with some alteration; lastly the blessing;
and then the Lord Chamberlain and the Comptroller of the Household bring
a basin, ewer, and towel, for his Majesty to wash.

    [Footnote 63: Pieces of money, so called from the figure of an angel
    on them.]

The King received a congratulatory address from the city of Cologne, in
Germany, where he had been some time in his exile; his Majesty saying
they were the best people in the world, the most kind and worthy to him
that he ever met with. I recommended Monsieur Messary to be Judge
Advocate in Jersey, by the Vice-Chamberlain's mediation with the Earl of
St. Albans; and saluted my excellent and worthy noble friend, my Lord
Ossory, son to the Marquis of Ormond, after many years' absence returned
home.

8th July, 1660. Mr. Henchman preached on Ephes. v. 5, concerning
Christian circumspection. From henceforth, was the Liturgy publicly used
in our churches, whence it had been for so many years banished.

15th July, 1660. Came Sir George Carteret and lady to visit us: he was
now Treasurer of the Navy.

28th July, 1660. I heard his Majesty's speech in the Lords' House, on
passing the Bills of Tonnage and Poundage; restoration of my Lord Ormond
to his estate in Ireland; concerning the commission of sewers, and
continuance of the excise. In the afternoon I saluted my old friend, the
Archbishop of Armagh, formerly of Londonderry (Dr. Bramhall). He
presented several Irish divines to be promoted as Bishops in that
kingdom, most of the Bishops in the three kingdoms being now almost worn
out, and the Sees vacant.

31st July, 1660. I went to visit Sir Philip Warwick, now secretary to the
Lord Treasurer, at his house in North Cray.

19th August, 1660. Our vicar read the Thirty-nine Articles to the
congregation, the national assemblies beginning now to settle, and
wanting instruction.

23d August, 1660. Came Duke Hamilton, Lord Lothian, and several Scottish
Lords, to see my garden.

25th August, 1660. Colonel Spencer, colonel of a regiment of horse in our
county of Kent, sent to me, and intreated that I would take a commission
for a troop of horse, and that I would nominate my lieutenant and
ensigns; I thanked him for the honor intended me; but would by no means
undertake the trouble.

4th September, 1660. I was invited to an ordination by the Bishop of
Bangor, in Henry VII.'s chapel, Westminster, and afterward saw the
audience of an Envoyée from the Duke of Anjou, sent to compliment his
Majesty's return.

5th September, 1660. Came to visit and dine with me the Envoyée of the
King of Poland, and Resident of the King of Denmark, etc.

7th September, 1660. I went to Chelsea to visit Mr. Boyle, and see his
pneumatic engine perform divers experiments. Thence, to Kensington, to
visit Mr. Henshaw, returning home that evening.

13th September, 1660. I saw in Southwark, at St. Margaret's fair, monkeys
and apes dance, and do other feats of activity on the high rope; they
were gallantly clad _á la monde_, went upright, saluted the company,
bowing and pulling off their hats; they saluted one another with as good
a grace as if instructed by a dancing master; they turned heels over head
with a basket having eggs in it, without breaking any; also, with lighted
candles in their hands, and on their heads, without extinguishing them,
and with vessels of water without spilling a drop. I also saw an Italian
wench dance, and perform all the tricks on the high rope to admiration;
all the Court went to see her. Likewise, here was a man who took up a
piece of iron cannon of about 400lb. weight with the hair of his head
only.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th September, 1660. Went to London, to see the splendid entry of the
Prince de Ligne, Ambassador extraordinary from Spain; he was general of
the Spanish King's horse in Flanders, and was accompanied with divers
great persons from thence, and an innumerable retinue. His train
consisted of seventeen coaches, with six horses of his own, besides a
great number of English, etc. Greater bravery had I never seen. He was
received in the Banqueting House, in exceeding state, all the great
officers of Court attending.

23d September, 1660. In the midst of all this joy and jubilee, the Duke
of Gloucester died of the smallpox, in the prime of youth, and a prince
of extraordinary hopes.

27th September, 1660. The King received the merchant's addresses in his
closet, giving them assurances of his persisting to keep Jamaica,
choosing Sir Edward Massey Governor. In the afternoon, the Danish
Ambassador's condolences were presented, on the death of the Duke of
Gloucester. This evening, I saw the Princess Royal, mother to the Prince
of Orange, now come out of Holland in a fatal period.

6th October, 1660. I paid the great tax of poll money, levied for
disbanding the army, till now kept up. I paid as an Esquire £10, and one
shilling for every servant in my house.

7th October, 1660. There dined with me a French count, with Sir George
Tuke, who came to take leave of me, being sent over to the Queen-Mother,
to break the marriage of the Duke with the daughter of Chancellor Hyde.
The Queen would fain have undone it; but it seems matters were
reconciled, on great offers of the Chancellor's to befriend the Queen,
who was much in debt, and was now to have the settlement of her affairs
go through his hands.

11th October, 1660. The regicides who sat on the life of our late King,
were brought to trial in the Old Bailey, before a commission of oyer and
terminer.

14th October, 1660. Axtall, Carew, Clement, Hacker, Hewson, and Peters,
were executed.

17th October, 1660. Scot, Scroop, Cook, and Jones, suffered for reward of
their iniquities at Charing Cross, in sight of the place where they put
to death their natural prince, and in the presence of the King his son,
whom they also sought to kill. I saw not their execution, but met their
quarters, mangled, and cut, and reeking, as they were brought from the
gallows in baskets on the hurdle. Oh, the miraculous providence of God!

28th October, 1660. His Majesty went to meet the Queen-Mother.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th October, 1660. Going to London, my Lord Mayor's show stopped me in
Cheapside; one of the pageants represented a great wood, with the royal
oak, and history of his Majesty's miraculous escape at Boscobel.

31st October, 1660. Arrived now to my fortieth year, I rendered to
Almighty God my due and hearty thanks.

1st November, 1660. I went with some of my relations to Court, to show
them his Majesty's cabinet and closet of rarities; the rare miniatures of
Peter Oliver, after Raphael, Titian, and other masters, which I
infinitely esteem; also, that large piece of the Duchess of Lennox, done
in enamel, by Petitot, and a vast number of agates, onyxes, and
intaglios, especially a medallion of Cæsar, as broad as my hand;
likewise, rare cabinets of pietra-commessa, a landscape of needlework,
formerly presented by the Dutch to King Charles I. Here I saw a vast book
of maps, in a volume near four yards large; a curious ship model; and,
among the clocks, one that showed the rising and setting of the sun in
the zodiac; the sun represented by a face and rays of gold, upon an azure
sky, observing the diurnal and annual motion, rising and setting behind a
landscape of hills,--the work of our famous Fromantil,--and several other
rarities.

3d October, 1660. Arrived the Queen-Mother in England, whence she had
been banished for almost twenty years; together with her illustrious
daughter, the Princess Henrietta, divers princes and noblemen,
accompanying them.

15th October, 1660. I kissed the Queen-Mother's hand.

20th October, 1660. I dined at the Clerk Comptroller's of the Green
Cloth, being the first day of the re-establishment of the Court diet, and
settling of his Majesty's household.

23d October, 1660. Being this day in the bedchamber of the Princess
Henrietta, where were many great beauties and noblemen, I saluted divers
of my old friends and acquaintances abroad; his Majesty carrying my wife
to salute the Queen and Princess, and then led her into his closet, and
with his own hands showed her divers curiosities.

25th October, 1660. Dr. Rainbow preached before the King, on Luke ii. 14,
of the glory to be given God for all his mercies, especially for
restoring the Church and government; now the service was performed with
music, voices, etc., as formerly.

27th November, 1660. Came down the Clerk Comptroller [of the Green Cloth]
by the Lord Steward's appointment, to survey the land at Sayes Court, on
which I had pretense, and to make his report.

6th December, 1660. I waited on my brother and sister Evelyn to Court.
Now were presented to his Majesty those two rare pieces of drollery, or
rather a Dutch Kitchen, painted by Dowe, so finely as hardly to be
distinguished from enamel. I was also shown divers rich jewels and
crystal vases; the rare head of Jo. Bellino, Titian's master; Christ in
the Garden, by Hannibal Caracci; two incomparable heads, by Holbein; the
Queen-Mother in a miniature, almost as big as the life; an exquisite
piece of carving; two unicorn's horns, etc. This in the closet.

13th December, 1660. I presented my son, John, to the Queen-Mother, who
kissed him, talked with and made extraordinary much of him.

14th December, 1660. I visited my Lady Chancellor, the Marchioness of
Ormond, and Countess of Guildford, all of whom we had known abroad in
exile.

18th December, 1660. I carried Mr. Spellman, a most ingenious gentleman,
grandchild to the learned Sir Henry, to my Lord Mordaunt, to whom I had
recommended him as secretary.

21st December, 1660. This day died the Princess of Orange, of the
smallpox, which entirely altered the face and gallantry of the whole
Court.

22d December, 1660. The marriage of the Chancellor's daughter being now
newly owned, I went to see her, she being Sir Richard Browne's intimate
acquaintance when she waited on the Princess of Orange; she was now at
her father's, at Worcester House, in the Strand. We all kissed her hand,
as did also my Lord Chamberlain (Manchester) and Countess of
Northumberland. This was a strange change--can it succeed well?--I spent
the evening at St. James's, whither the Princess Henrietta was retired
during the fatal sickness of her sister, the Princess of Orange, now come
over to salute the King her brother. The Princess gave my wife an
extraordinary compliment and gracious acceptance, for the "Character"[64]
she had presented her the day before, and which was afterward printed.

    [Footnote 64: "A Character of England," reprinted in Evelyn's
    "Miscellaneous Writings," pp. 141-67.]

25th December, 1660. Preached at the Abbey, Dr. Earle, Clerk of his
Majesty's Closet, and my dear friend, now Dean of Westminster, on Luke
ii. 13, 14, condoling the breach made in the public joy by the lamented
death of the Princess.

30th December, 1660. I dined at Court with Mr. Crane, Clerk of the Green
Cloth.

31st December, 1660. I gave God thanks for his many signal mercies to
myself, church, and nation, this wonderful year.

2d January, 1661. The Queen-Mother, with the Princess Henrietta, began
her journey to Portsmouth, in order to her return into France.

5th January, 1661. I visited my Lord Chancellor Clarendon, with whom I
had been well acquainted abroad.

6th January, 1661. Dr. Allestree preached at the Abbey, after which four
Bishops were consecrated, Hereford, Norwich, ...

This night was suppressed a bloody insurrection of some FIFTH-MONARCHY
ENTHUSIASTS. Some of them were examined at the Council the next day; but
could say nothing to extenuate their madness and unwarrantable zeal.

I was now chosen (and nominated by his Majesty for one of the Council),
by suffrage of the rest of the members, a Fellow of the Philosophic
Society now meeting at Gresham College, where was an assembly of divers
learned gentlemen. This being the first meeting since the King's return;
but it had been begun some years before at Oxford, and was continued with
interruption here in London during the Rebellion.

There was another rising of the fanatics, in which some were slain.

16th January, 1661. I went to the Philosophic Club, where was examined
the Torricellian experiment. I presented my Circle of Mechanical Trades,
and had recommended to me the publishing what I had written of
Chalcography.

25th January, 1661. After divers years since I had seen any play, I went
to see acted "The Scornful Lady," at a new theater in Lincoln's-Inn
Fields.

30th January, 1661. Was the first solemn fast and day of humiliation to
deplore the sins which had so long provoked God against this afflicted
church and people, ordered by Parliament to be annually celebrated to
expiate the guilt of the execrable murder of the late King.

This day (Oh, the stupendous and inscrutable judgments of God!) were the
carcasses of those arch-rebels, Cromwell, Bradshawe (the judge who
condemned his Majesty), and Ireton (son-in-law to the Usurper), dragged
out of their superb tombs in Westminster among the Kings, to Tyburn, and
hanged on the gallows there from nine in the morning till six at night,
and then buried under that fatal and ignominious monument in a deep pit;
thousands of people who had seen them in all their pride being
spectators. Look back at October 22, 1658,[65] and be astonished! and
fear God and honor the King; but meddle not with them who are given to
change!

    [Footnote 65: The entry in the "Diary" describing the Protector's
    funeral.]

6th February, 1661. To London, to our Society, where I gave notice of the
visit of the Danish Ambassador-Extraordinary, and was ordered to return
him their acceptance of that honor, and to invite him the next meeting
day.

10th February, 1661. Dr. Baldero preached at Ely-house, on Matthew vi.
33, of seeking early the kingdom of God; after sermon, the Bishop (Dr.
Wren) gave us the blessing, very pontifically.

13th February, 1661. I conducted the Danish Ambassador to our meeting at
Gresham College, where were shown him various experiments in vacuo, and
other curiosities.

21st February, 1661. Prince Rupert first showed me how to grave in _mezzo
tinto_.

26th February, 1661. I went to Lord Mordaunt's, at Parson's Green.

27th February, 1661. Ash Wednesday. Preached before the King the Bishop
of London (Dr. Sheldon) on Matthew xviii. 25, concerning charity and
forgiveness.

8th March, 1661. I went to my Lord Chancellor's, and delivered to him the
state of my concernment at Sayes Court.

9th March, 1661. I went with that excellent person and philosopher, Sir
Robert Murray, to visit Mr. Boyle at Chelsea, and saw divers effects of
the eolipile for weighing air.

13th March, 1661. I went to Lambeth, with Sir R. Browne's pretense to the
Wardenship of Merton College, Oxford, to which, as having been about
forty years before a student of that house, he was elected by the votes
of every Fellow except one; but the statutes of the house being so that,
unless every Fellow agree, the election devolves to the Visitor, who is
the Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Juxon), his Grace gave his nomination
to Sir T. Clayton, resident there, and the Physic Professor: for which I
was not at all displeased, because, though Sir Richard missed it by much
ingratitude and wrong of the Archbishop (Clayton being no Fellow), yet it
would have hindered Sir Richard from attending at Court to settle his
greater concerns, and so have prejudiced me, though he was much inclined
to have passed his time in a collegiate life, very unfit for him at that
time, for many reasons. So I took leave of his Grace, who was formerly
Lord Treasurer in the reign of Charles I.

This afternoon, Prince Rupert showed me, with his own hands, the new way
of graving, called _mezzo tinto_, which afterward, by his permission, I
published in my "History of Chalcography"; this set so many artists on
work, that they soon arrived to the perfection it is since come to,
emulating the tenderest miniatures.

Our Society now gave in my relation of the Peak of Teneriffe, in the
Great Canaries, to be added to more queries concerning divers natural
things reported of that island.

I returned home with my Cousin, Tuke, now going for France, as sent by
his Majesty to condole the death of that great Minister and politician,
Count Mazarine.

29th March, 1661. Dr. Heylin (author of the "Geography") preached at the
Abbey, on Cant. v. 25, concerning friendship and charity; he was, I
think, at this time quite dark, and so had been for some years.

31st March, 1661. This night, his Majesty promised to make my wife Lady
of the Jewels (a very honorable charge) to the future Queen (but which he
never performed).

1st April, 1661. I dined with that great mathematician and virtuoso,
Monsieur Zulichem, inventor of the pendule clock, and discoverer of the
phenomenon of Saturn's annulus: he was elected into our Society.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th April, 1661. To London, and saw the bathing and rest of the
ceremonies of the Knights of the Bath, preparatory to the coronation; it
was in the Painted Chamber, Westminster. I might have received this
honor; but declined it. The rest of the ceremony was in the chapel at
Whitehall, when their swords being laid on the altar, the Bishop
delivered them.

22d April, 1661. Was the splendid cavalcade of his Majesty from the Tower
of London to Whitehall, when I saw him in the Banqueting House create six
Earls, and as many Barons, viz:

Edward Lord Hyde, Lord Chancellor, Earl of Clarendon; supported by the
Earls of Northumberland and Sussex; the Earl of Bedford carried the cap
and coronet, the Earl of Warwick, the sword, the Earl of Newport, the
mantle.

  Next, was Capel, created Earl of Essex.
            Brudenell,             Cardigan;
            Valentia,              Anglesea;
            Greenvill,             Bath; and
            Howard, Earl of Carlisle.

The Barons were: Denzille Holles; Cornwallis; Booth; Townsend; Cooper;
Crew; who were led up by several Peers, with Garter and officers of arms
before them; when, after obedience on their several approaches to the
throne, their patents were presented by Garter King-at-Arms, which being
received by the Lord Chamberlain, and delivered to his Majesty, and by
him to the Secretary of State, were read, and then again delivered to his
Majesty, and by him to the several Lords created; they were then robed,
their coronets and collars put on by his Majesty, and they were placed in
rank on both sides of the state and throne; but the Barons put off their
caps and circles, and held them in their hands, the Earls keeping on
their coronets, as cousins to the King.

I spent the rest of the evening in seeing the several archtriumphals
built in the streets at several eminent places through which his Majesty
was next day to pass, some of which, though temporary, and to stand but
one year, were of good invention and architecture, with inscriptions.

23d April, 1661. Was the coronation of his Majesty Charles II. in the
Abbey-Church of Westminster; at all which ceremony I was present. The
King and his Nobility went to the Tower, I accompanying my Lord Viscount
Mordaunt part of the way; this was on Sunday, the 22d; but indeed his
Majesty went not till early this morning, and proceeded from thence to
Westminster in this order:

First went the Duke of York's Horse Guards. Messengers of the Chamber.
136 Esquires to the Knights of the Bath, each of whom had two, most
richly habited. The Knight Harbinger. Sergeant Porter. Sewers of the
Chamber. Quarter Waiters. Six Clerks of Chancery. Clerk of the Signet.

Tents, Revels, Ceremonies, Armory, Wardrobe, Ordnance, Requests.
Chamberlain of the Exchequer. Barons of the Exchequer. Judges. Lord
Chief-Baron. Lord Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas. Master of the Rolls.
Lord Chief-Justice of England. Trumpets. Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber.
Knights of the Bath, 68, in crimson robes, exceeding rich, and the
noblest show of the whole cavalcade, his Majesty excepted. Knight

The KING, in royal robes and equipage. Afterward, followed equerries,
footmen, gentlemen pensioners. Master of the Horse, leading a horse
richly caparisoned. Vice-Chamberlain. Captain of the Pensioners. Captain
of the Guard. The Guard. The Horse Guard. The troop of Volunteers, with
many other officers and gentlemen.

This magnificent train on horseback, as rich as embroidery, velvet, cloth
of gold and silver, and jewels, could make them and their prancing
horses, proceeded through the streets strewed with flowers, houses hung
with rich tapestry, windows and balconies full of ladies; the London
militia lining the ways, and the several companies, with their banners
and loud music, ranked in their orders; the fountains running wine, bells
ringing, with speeches made at the several triumphal arches; at that of
the Temple Bar (near which I stood) the Lord Mayor was received by the
Bailiff of Westminster, who, in a scarlet robe, made a speech. Thence,
with joyful acclamations, his Majesty passed to Whitehall. Bonfires at
night.

The next day, being St. George's, he went by water to Westminster Abbey.
When his Majesty was entered, the Dean and Prebendaries brought all the
regalia, and delivered them to several noblemen to bear before the King,
who met them at the west door of the church, singing an anthem, to the
choir. Then, came the Peers, in their robes, and coronets in their hands,
till his Majesty was placed on a throne elevated before the altar.
Afterward, the Bishop of London (the Archbishop of Canterbury being sick)
went to every side of the throne to present the King to the people,
asking if they would have him for their King, and do him homage; at this,
they shouted four times "God save King Charles II!" Then, an anthem was
sung. His Majesty, attended by three Bishops, went up to the altar, and
he offered a pall and a pound of gold. Afterward, he sat down in another
chair during the sermon, which was preached by Dr. Morley, Bishop of
Worcester.

After sermon, the King took his oath before the altar to maintain the
religion, Magna Charta, and laws of the land. The hymn _Véni S. Sp._
followed, and then the Litany by two Bishops. Then the Archbishop of
Canterbury, present, but much indisposed and weak, said "Lift up your
hearts"; at which, the King rose up, and put off his robes and upper
garments, and was in a waistcoat so opened in divers places, that the
Archbishop might commodiously anoint him, first in the palms of his
hands, when an anthem was sung, and a prayer read; then, his breast and
between the shoulders, bending of both arms; and, lastly, on the crown of
the head, with apposite hymns and prayers at each anointing; this done,
the Dean closed and buttoned up the waistcoat. After which, was a coif
put on, and the cobbium, sindon or dalmatic, and over this a super-tunic
of cloth of gold, with buskins and sandals of the same, spurs, and the
sword; a prayer being first said over it by the Archbishop on the altar,
before it was girt on by the Lord Chamberlain. Then, the armill, mantle,
etc. Then, the Archbishop placed the crown imperial on the altar, prayed
over it, and set it on his Majesty's head, at which all the Peers put on
their coronets. Anthems, and rare music, with lutes, viols, trumpets,
organs, and voices, were then heard, and the Archbishop put a ring on his
Majesty's finger. The King next offered his sword on the altar, which
being redeemed, was drawn, and borne before him. Then, the Archbishop
delivered him the sceptre, with the dove in one hand, and, in the other,
the sceptre with the globe. The King kneeling, the Archbishop pronounced
the blessing. His Majesty then ascending again his royal throne, while
_Te Deum_ was singing, all the Peers did their homage, by every one
touching his crown. The Archbishop, and the rest of the Bishops, first
kissing the King; who received the Holy Sacrament, and so disrobed, yet
with the crown imperial on his head, and accompanied with all the
nobility in the former order, he went on foot upon blue cloth, which was
spread and reached from the west door of the Abbey to Westminster stairs,
when he took water in a triumphal barge to Whitehall where was
extraordinary feasting.

24th April, 1661. I presented his Majesty with his "Panegyric"[66] in the
Privy Chamber, which he was pleased to accept most graciously; I gave
copies to the Lord Chancellor, and most of the noblemen who came to me
for it. I dined at the Marquis of Ormond's where was a magnificent feast,
and many great persons.

    [Footnote 66: A poem which Evelyn had composed on his Majesty's
    Coronation; the 23d of April, 1661, being St. George's day.]

1st May, 1661. I went to Hyde Park to take the air, where was his Majesty
and an innumerable appearance of gallants and rich coaches, being now a
time of universal festivity and joy.

2d May, 1661. I had audience of my Lord Chancellor about my title to
Sayes Court.

3d May, 1661. I went to see the wonderful engine for weaving silk
stockings, said to have been the invention of an Oxford scholar forty
years since; and I returned by Fromantil's, the famous clockmaker, to see
some pendules, Monsieur Zulichem being with us.

This evening, I was with my Lord Brouncker, Sir Robert Murray, Sir
Patrick Neill, Monsieur Zulichem, and Bull (all of them of our Society,
and excellent mathematicians), to show his Majesty, who was present,
Saturn's annulus, as some thought, but as Zulichem affirmed with his
_balteus_ (as that learned gentleman had published), very near eclipsed
by the moon, near the Mons Porphyritis; also, Jupiter and satellites,
through his Majesty's great telescope, drawing thirty-five feet; on which
were divers discourses.

8th May, 1661. His Majesty rode in state, with his imperial crown on, and
all the peers in their robes, in great pomp to the Parliament now newly
chosen (the old one being dissolved); and, that evening, declared in
council his intention to marry the Infanta of Portugal.

9th May, 1661. At Sir Robert Murray's, where I met Dr. Wallis, Professor
of Geometry in Oxford, where was discourse of several mathematical
subjects.

11th May, 1661. My wife presented to his Majesty the Madonna she had
copied in miniature from P. Oliver's painting, after Raphael, which she
wrought with extraordinary pains and judgment. The King was infinitely
pleased with it, and caused it to be placed in his cabinet among his best
paintings.

13th May, 1661. I heard and saw such exercises at the election of
scholars at Westminster School to be sent to the University in Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, in themes and extemporary verses, as
wonderfully astonished me in such youths, with such readiness and wit,
some of them not above twelve or thirteen years of age. Pity it is, that
what they attain here so ripely, they either do not retain, or do not
improve more considerably when they come to be men, though many of them
do; and no less is to be blamed their odd pronouncing of Latin, so that
out of England none were able to understand, or endure it. The
examinants, or posers, were, Dr. Duport, Greek Professor at Cambridge;
Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford; Dr. Pierson; Dr. Allestree, Dean
of Westminster, and any that would.

14th May, 1661. His Majesty was pleased to discourse with me concerning
several particulars relating to our Society, and the planet Saturn, etc.,
as he sat at supper in the withdrawing-room to his bedchamber.

16th May, 1661. I dined with Mr. Garmus, the Resident from Hamburg, who
continued his feast near nine whole hours, according to the custom of his
country, though there was no great excess of drinking, no man being
obliged to take more than he liked.

22d May, 1661. The Scotch Covenant was burnt by the common hangman in
divers places in London. Oh, prodigious change!

29th May, 1661. This was the first anniversary appointed by act of
Parliament to be observed as a day of general thanksgiving for the
miraculous restoration of his Majesty: our vicar preaching on Psalm
cxviii. 24, requiring us to be thankful and rejoice, as indeed we had
cause.

4th June, 1661. Came Sir Charles Harbord, his Majesty's surveyor, to take
an account of what grounds I challenged at Sayes Court.

27th June, 1661. I saw the Portugal ambassador at dinner with his Majesty
in state, where was excellent music.

2d July, 1661. I went to see the New Spring-Garden, at Lambeth, a
prettily contrived plantation.

[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

19th July, 1661. We tried our Diving-Bell, or engine, in the water dock
at Deptford, in which our curator continued half an hour under water; it
was made of cast lead, let down with a strong cable.

3d August, 1661. Came my Lord Hatton, Comptroller of his Majesty's
household to visit me.

9th August, 1661. I tried several experiments on the sensitive plant and
_humilis_, which contracted with the least touch of the sun through a
burning glass, though it rises and opens only when it shines on it.

I first saw the famous Queen Pine brought from Barbadoes, and presented
to his Majesty; but the first that were ever seen in England were those
sent to Cromwell four years since.

I dined at Mr. Palmer's in Gray's Inn, whose curiosity excelled in clocks
and pendules, especially one that had innumerable motions, and played
nine or ten tunes on the bells very finely, some of them set in parts:
which was very harmonious. It was wound up but once in a quarter. He had
also good telescopes and mathematical instruments, choice pictures, and
other curiosities. Thence, we went to that famous mountebank, Jo.
Punteus.

Sir Kenelm Digby presented every one of us his "Discourse of the
Vegetation of Plants"; and Mr. Henshaw, his "History of Saltpeter and
Gunpowder." I assisted him to procure his place of French Secretary to
the King, which he purchased of Sir Henry De Vic.

I went to that famous physician, Sir Fr. Prujean, who showed me his
laboratory, his workhouse for turning, and other mechanics; also many
excellent pictures, especially the Magdalen of Caracci; and some
incomparable _paysages_ done in distemper; he played to me likewise on
the _polythore_, an instrument having something of the harp, lute, and
theorbo; by none known in England, nor described by any author, nor used,
but by this skillful and learned Doctor.

15th August, 1661. I went to Tunbridge-Wells, my wife being there for the
benefit of her health. Walking about the solitudes, I greatly admired the
extravagant turnings, insinuations, and growth of certain birch trees
among the rocks.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th September, 1661. I presented my "_Fumifugium_"[67] dedicated to his
Majesty, who was pleased that I should publish it by his special
commands, being much gratified with it.

    Writings."]

18th September, 1661. This day was read our petition to his Majesty for
his royal grant, authorizing our Society to meet as a corporation, with
several privileges.

An exceedingly sickly, wet autumn.

1st October, 1661. I sailed this morning with his Majesty in one of his
yachts (or pleasure boats), vessels not known among us till the Dutch
East India Company presented that curious piece to the King; being very
excellent sailing vessels. It was on a wager between his other new
pleasure boat, built frigate-like, and one of the Duke of York's; the
wager £100; the race from Greenwich to Gravesend and back. The King lost
it going, the wind being contrary, but saved stakes in returning. There
were divers noble persons and lords on board, his Majesty sometimes
steering himself. His barge and kitchen boat attended. I brake fast this
morning with the King at return in his smaller vessel, he being pleased
to take me and only four more, who were noblemen, with him; but dined in
his yacht, where we all ate together with his Majesty. In this passage he
was pleased to discourse to me about my book inveighing against the
nuisance of the smoke of London, and proposing expedients how, by
removing those particulars I mentioned, it might be reformed; commanding
me to prepare a Bill against the next session of Parliament, being, as he
said, resolved to have something done in it. Then he discoursed to me of
the improvement of gardens and buildings, now very rare in England
comparatively to other countries. He then commanded me to draw up the
matter of fact happening at the bloody encounter which then had newly
happened between the French and Spanish Ambassadors near the Tower,
contending for precedency, at the reception of the Swedish Ambassador;
giving me orders to consult Sir William Compton, Master of the Ordnance,
to inform me of what he knew of it, and with his favorite, Sir Charles
Berkeley, captain of the Duke's life guard, then present with his troop
and three foot companies; with some other reflections and instructions,
to be prepared with a declaration to take off the reports which went
about of his Majesty's partiality in the affairs, and of his officers'
and spectators' rudeness while the conflict lasted. So I came home that
night, and went next morning to London, where from the officers of the
Tower, Sir William Compton, Sir Charles Berkeley, and others who were
attending at this meeting of the Ambassadors three days before, having
collected what I could, I drew up a Narrative in vindication of his
Majesty, and the carriage of his officers and standers-by.

On Thursday his Majesty sent one of the pages of the back stairs for me
to wait on him with my papers, in his cabinet where was present only Sir
Henry Bennett (Privy-Purse), when beginning to read to his Majesty what I
had drawn up, by the time I had read half a page, came in Mr. Secretary
Morice with a large paper, desiring to speak with his Majesty, who told
him he was now very busy, and therefore ordered him to come again some
other time; the Secretary replied that what he had in his hand was of
extraordinary importance. So the King rose up, and, commanding me to
stay, went aside to a corner of the room with the Secretary; after a
while, the Secretary being dispatched, his Majesty returning to me at
the table, a letter was brought him from Madame out of France;[68] this
he read and then bid me proceed from where I left off. This I did till I
had ended all the narrative, to his Majesty's great satisfaction; and,
after I had inserted one or two more clauses, in which his Majesty
instructed me, commanded that it should that night be sent to the
posthouse, directed to the Lord Ambassador at Paris (the Earl of St.
Alban's), and then at leisure to prepare him a copy, which he would
publish. This I did, and immediately sent my papers to the Secretary of
State, with his Majesty's express command of dispatching them that night
for France. Before I went out of the King's closet, he called me back to
show me some ivory statues, and other curiosities that I had not seen
before.

    [Footnote 68: Henrietta Maria.]

3d October, 1661. Next evening, being in the withdrawing-room adjoining
the bedchamber, his Majesty espying me came to me from a great crowd of
noblemen standing near the fire, and asked me if I had done; and told me
he feared it might be a little too sharp, on second thoughts, for he had
that morning spoken with the French Ambassador, who it seems had
palliated the matter, and was very tame; and therefore directed me where
I should soften a period or two, before it was published (as afterward it
was). This night also he spoke to me to give him a sight of what was
sent, and to bring it to him in his bedchamber; which I did, and received
it again from him at dinner, next day. By Saturday, having finished it
with all his Majesty's notes, the King being gone abroad, I sent the
papers to Sir Henry Bennett (Privy-Purse and a great favorite), and
slipped home, being myself much indisposed and harassed with going about,
and sitting up to write.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th October, 1661. I went to London to visit my Lord of Bristol, having
been with Sir John Denham (his Majesty's surveyor) to consult with him
about the placing of his palace at Greenwich, which I would have had
built between the river and the Queen's house, so as a large square cut
should have let in the Thames like a bay; but Sir John was for setting it
on piles at the very brink of the water, which I did not assent to; and
so came away, knowing Sir John to be a better poet than architect,
though he had Mr. Webb (Inigo Jones's man) to assist him.

29th October, 1661. I saw the Lord Mayor pass in his water triumph to
Westminster, being the first solemnity of this nature after twenty years.

2d November, 1661. Came Sir Henry Bennett, since Lord Arlington, to visit
me, and to acquaint me that his Majesty would do me the honor to come and
see my garden; but, it being then late, it was deferred.

3d November, 1661. One Mr. Breton preached his probation sermon at our
parish church, and indeed made a most excellent discourse on John i. 29,
of God's free grace to penitents, so that I could not but recommend him
to the patron.

10th November, 1661. In the afternoon, preached at the Abbey Dr. Basire,
that great traveler, or rather French Apostle, who had been planting the
Church of England in divers parts of the Levant and Asia. He showed that
the Church of England was, for purity of doctrine, substance, decency,
and beauty, the most perfect under Heaven; that England was the very land
of Goshen.

11th November, 1661. I was so idle as to go to see a play called "Love
and Honor." Dined at Arundel House; and that evening discoursed with his
Majesty about shipping, in which he was exceedingly skillful.

15th November, 1661. I dined with the Duke of Ormond, who told me there
were no moles in Ireland, nor any rats till of late, and that in but one
county; but it was a mistake that spiders would not live there, only they
were not poisonous. Also, that they frequently took salmon with dogs.

16th November, 1661. I presented my translation of "Naudæus concerning
Libraries" to my Lord Chancellor; but it was miserably false printed.

17th November, 1661. Dr. Creighton, a Scot, author of the "Florentine
Council," and a most eloquent man and admirable Grecian, preached on
Cant. vi. 13, celebrating the return and restoration of the Church and
King.

20th November, 1661. At the Royal Society, Sir William Petty proposed
divers things for the improvement of shipping; a versatile keel that
should be on hinges and concerning sheathing ships with thin lead.

24th November, 1661. This night his Majesty fell into discourse with me
concerning bees, etc.

26th November, 1661. I saw "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" played; but now
the old plays began to disgust this refined age, since his Majesty's
being so long abroad.

28th November, 1661. I dined at Chiffinch's house-warming, in St. James's
Park; he was his Majesty's closet-keeper, and had his new house full of
good pictures, etc. There dined with us Russell, Popish Bishop of Cape
Verd, who was sent out to negotiate his Majesty's match with the Infanta
of Portugal, after the Ambassador was returned.

29th November, 1661. I dined at the Countess of Peterborough's and went
that evening to Parson's Green with my Lord Mordaunt, with whom I stayed
that night.

1st December, 1661. I took leave of my Lord Peterborough, going now to
Tangier, which was to be delivered to the English on the match with
Portugal.

3d December, 1661. By universal suffrage of our philosophic assembly, an
order was made and registered that I should receive their public thanks
for the honorable mention I made of them by the name of Royal Society, in
my Epistle dedicatory to the Lord Chancellor, before my Traduction of
Naudæus. Too great an honor for a trifle.

4th December, 1661. I had much discourse with the Duke of York,
concerning strange cures he affirmed of a woman who swallowed a whole ear
of barley, which worked out at her side. I told him of the KNIFE
SWALLOWED[69] and the pins.

    [Footnote 69: This refers to the Dutchman, _ante_, 28th August,
    1641; and to an extraordinary case contained in a "Miraculous Cure
    of the Prussian Swallow Knife, etc., by Dan Lakin, P. C." quarto,
    London, 1642, with a woodcut representing the object of the cure and
    the size of the knife.]

I took leave of the Bishop of Cape Verd, now going in the fleet to bring
over our new Queen.

7th December, 1661. I dined at Arundel House, the day when the great
contest in Parliament was concerning the restoring the Duke of Norfolk;
however, it was carried for him. I also presented my little trifle of
Sumptuary Laws, entitled "Tyrannus" [or "The Mode"].

14th December, 1661. I saw otter hunting with the King, and killed one.

16th December, 1661. I saw a French comedy acted at Whitehall.

20th December, 1661. The Bishop of Gloucester preached at the Abbey at
the funeral of the Bishop of Hereford, brother to the Duke of Albemarle.
It was a decent solemnity. There was a silver miter, with episcopal
robes, borne by the herald before the hearse, which was followed by the
Duke his brother, and all the bishops, with divers noblemen.

23d December, 1661. I heard an Italian play and sing to the guitar with
extraordinary skill before the Duke.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st January, 1661-62. I went to London, invited to the solemn foolery of
the Prince de la Grange, at Lincoln's-Inn, where came the King, Duke,
etc. It began with a grand masque, and a formal pleading before the mock
Princes, Grandees, Nobles, and Knights of the Sun. He had his Lord
Chancellor, Chamberlain, Treasurer, and other Royal Officers, gloriously
clad and attended. It ended in a magnificent banquet. One Mr. Lort was
the young spark who maintained the pageantry.

6th January, 1662. This evening, according to custom, his Majesty opened
the revels of that night by throwing the dice himself in the privy
chamber, where was a table set on purpose, and lost his £100. (The year
before he won £1,500.) The ladies also played very deep. I came away when
the Duke of Ormond had won about £1,000, and left them still at passage,
cards, etc. At other tables, both there and at the groom-porter's,
observing the wicked folly and monstrous excess of passion among some
losers; sorry am I that such a wretched custom as play to that excess
should be countenanced in a Court, which ought to be an example of virtue
to the rest of the kingdom.

9th January, 1662. I saw acted "The Third Part of the Siege of Rhodes."
In this acted the fair and famous comedian called Roxalana from the part
she performed; and I think it was the last, she being taken to be the
Earl of Oxford's MISS (as at this time they began to call lewd women). It
was in recitative music.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th January, 1662. Being called into his Majesty's closet when Mr.
Cooper, the rare limner, was crayoning of the King's face and head, to
make the stamps for the new milled money now contriving, I had the honor
to hold the candle while it was doing, he choosing the night and
candlelight for the better finding out the shadows. During this, his
Majesty discoursed with me on several things relating to painting and
graving.

11th January, 1662. I dined at Arundel House, where I heard excellent
music performed by the ablest masters, both French and English, on
theorbos, viols, organs, and voices, as an exercise against the coming of
the Queen, purposely composed for her chapel. Afterward, my Lord Aubigny
(her Majesty's Almoner to be) showed us his elegant lodging, and his
wheel-chair for ease and motion, with divers other curiosities;
especially a kind of artificial glass, or porcelain, adorned with
relievos of paste, hard and beautiful. Lord Aubigny (brother to the Duke
of Lennox) was a person of good sense, but wholly abandoned to ease and
effeminacy.

I received of Sir Peter Ball, the Queen's attorney, a draft of an Act
against the nuisance of the smoke of London, to be reformed by removing
several trades which are the cause of it, and endanger the health of the
King and his people. It was to have been offered to the Parliament, as
his Majesty commanded.

12th January, 1662. At St. James's chapel preached, or rather harangued,
the famous orator, Monsieur Morus, in French. There were present the
King, Duke, French Ambassador, Lord Aubigny, Earl of Bristol, and a world
of Roman Catholics, drawn thither to hear this eloquent Protestant.

15th January, 1662. There was a general fast through the whole nation,
and now celebrated in London, to avert God's heavy judgments on this
land. Great rain had fallen without any frost, or seasonable cold, not
only in England, but in Sweden, and the most northern parts, being here
near as warm as at midsummer in some years.

This solemn fast was held for the House of Commons at St. Margaret's. Dr.
Reeves, Dean of Windsor, preached on Joshua vii. 12, showing how the
neglect of exacting justice on offenders (by which he insinuated such of
the old King's murderers as were yet reprieved and in the Tower) was a
main cause of God's punishing a land. He brought in that of the
Gibeonites, as well as Achan and others, concluding with an eulogy of the
Parliament for their loyalty in restoring the Bishops and Clergy, and
vindicating the Church from sacrilege.

16th January, 1662. Having notice of the Duke of York's intention to
visit my poor habitation and garden this day, I returned, when he was
pleased to do me that honor of his own accord, and to stay some time
viewing such things as I had to entertain his curiosity. Afterward he
caused me to dine with him at the Treasurer of the Navy's house, and to
sit with him covered at the same table. There were his Highness, the Duke
of Ormond, and several Lords. Then they viewed some of my grounds about a
project for a receptacle for ships to be moored in, which was laid aside
as a fancy of Sir Nicholas Crisp. After this, I accompanied the Duke to
an East India vessel that lay at Blackwall, where we had entertainment of
several curiosities. Among other spirituous drinks, as punch, etc., they
gave us Canary that had been carried to and brought from the Indies,
which was indeed incomparably good. I returned to London with his
Highness. This night was acted before his Majesty "The Widow," a lewd
play.

18th January, 1662. I came home to be private a little, not at all
affecting the life and hurry of Court.

24th January, 1662. His Majesty entertained me with his intentions of
building his Palace of Greenwich, and quite demolishing the old one; on
which I declared my thoughts.

25th January, 1662. I dined with the Trinity Company at their house, that
corporation being by charter fixed at Deptford.

3d February, 1662. I went to Chelsea, to see Sir Arthur Gorges' house.

11th February, 1662. I saw a comedy acted before the Duchess of York at
the Cockpit. The King was not at it.

17th February, 1662. I went with my Lord of Bristol to see his house at
Wimbledon, newly bought of the Queen-Mother, to help contrive the garden
after the modern. It is a delicious place for prospect and the thickets,
but the soil cold and weeping clay. Returned that evening with Sir Henry
Bennett.

This night was buried in Westminster Abbey the Queen of Bohemia, after
all her sorrows and afflictions being come to die in the arms of her
nephew, the King; also this night and the next day fell such a storm of
hail, thunder, and lightning, as never was seen the like in any man's
memory, especially the tempest of wind, being southwest, which subverted,
besides huge trees, many houses, innumerable chimneys (among others that
of my parlor at Sayes Court), and made such havoc at land and sea, that
several perished on both. Divers lamentable fires were also kindled at
this time; so exceedingly was God's hand against this ungrateful and
vicious nation and Court.

20th February, 1662. I returned home to repair my house, miserably
shattered by the late tempest.

24th March, 1662. I returned home with my whole family, which had been
most part of the winter, since October, at London, in lodgings near the
Abbey of Westminster.

6th April, 1662. Being of the Vestry, in the afternoon we ordered that
the communion-table should be set (as usual) altar-wise, with a decent
rail in front, as before the Rebellion.

17th April, 1662. The young Marquis of Argyle, whose turbulent father was
executed in Scotland, came to see my garden. He seemed a man of parts.

7th May, 1662. I waited on Prince Rupert to our Assembly where were tried
several experiments in Mr. Boyle's VACUUM. A man thrusting in his arm,
upon exhaustion of the air, had his flesh immediately swelled so as the
blood was near bursting the veins: he drawing it out, we found it all
speckled.

14th May, 1662. To London, being chosen one of the Commissioners for
reforming the buildings, ways, streets, and incumbrances, and regulating
the hackney coaches in the city of London, taking my oath before my Lord
Chancellor, and then went to his Majesty's Surveyor's office, in Scotland
Yard, about naming and establishing officers, adjourning till the 16th,
when I went to view how St. Martin's Lane might be made more passable
into the Strand. There were divers gentlemen of quality in this
commission.

25th May, 1662. I went this evening to London, in order to our journey
to Hampton Court, to see the Queen; who, having landed at Portsmouth, had
been married to the King a week before by the Bishop of London.

30th May, 1662. The Queen arrived with a train of Portuguese ladies in
their monstrous fardingales, or guard-infantes, their complexions
olivader[70] and sufficiently unagreeable. Her Majesty in the same habit,
her foretop long and turned aside very strangely. She was yet of the
handsomest countenance of all the rest, and, though low of stature,
prettily shaped, languishing and excellent eyes, her teeth wronging her
mouth by sticking a little too far out; for the rest, lovely enough.

    [Footnote 70: Of a dark olive complexion. It has been noticed in
    other accounts that Katharine of Braganza's Portuguese Ladies of
    Honor, who came over with her, were uncommonly ill-favored, and
    disagreeable in their appearance. See Faithorne's curious print of
    the Queen in the costume here described.]

31st May, 1662. I saw the Queen at dinner; the Judges came to compliment
her arrival, and, after them, the Duke of Ormond brought me to kiss her
hand.

2d June, 1662. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen made their addresses to the
Queen, presenting her £1,000 in gold. Now saw I her Portuguese ladies,
and the Guardadamas, or mother of her maids,[71] and the old knight, a
lock of whose hair quite covered the rest of his bald pate, bound on by a
thread, very oddly. I saw the rich gondola sent to his Majesty from the
State of Venice; but it was not comparable for swiftness to our common
wherries, though managed by Venetians.

    [Footnote 71: The Maids of Honor had a mother at least as early as
    the reign of Elizabeth. The office is supposed to have been
    abolished about the period of the Revolution of 1688.]

4th June, 1662. Went to visit the Earl of Bristol, at Wimbledon.

8th June, 1662. I saw her Majesty at supper privately in her bedchamber.

9th June, 1662. I heard the Queen's Portugal music, consisting of pipes,
harps, and very ill voices.

[Sidenote: HAMPTON COURT]

Hampton Court is as noble and uniform a pile, and as capacious as any
Gothic architecture can have made it. There is an incomparable furniture
in it, especially hangings designed by Raphael, very rich with gold; also
many rare pictures, especially the Cæsarean Triumphs of Andrea Mantegna,
formerly the Duke of Mantua's; of the tapestries, I believe the world can
show nothing nobler of the kind than the stories of Abraham and Tobit.
The gallery of horns is very particular for the vast beams of stags,
elks, antelopes, etc. The Queen's bed was an embroidery of silver on
crimson velvet, and cost £8,000, being a present made by the States of
Holland when his Majesty returned, and had formerly been given by them to
our King's sister, the Princess of Orange, and, being bought of her
again, was now presented to the King. The great looking-glass and toilet,
of beaten and massive gold, was given by the Queen-Mother. The Queen
brought over with her from Portugal such Indian cabinets as had never
before been seen here. The great hall is a most magnificent room. The
chapel roof excellently fretted and gilt. I was also curious to visit the
wardrobe and tents, and other furniture of state. The park, formerly a
flat and naked piece of ground, now planted with sweet rows of lime
trees; and the canal for water now near perfected; also the air-park. In
the garden is a rich and noble fountain, with Sirens, statues, etc., cast
in copper, by Fanelli; but no plenty of water. The cradle-work of horn
beam in the garden is, for the perplexed twining of the trees, very
observable. There is a parterre which they call Paradise, in which is a
pretty banqueting-house set over a cave, or cellar. All these gardens
might be exceedingly improved, as being too narrow for such a palace.

10th June, 1662. I returned to London, and presented my "History of
Chalcography" (dedicated to Mr. Boyle) to our Society.[72]

    [Footnote 72: See Evelyn's "Miscellaneous Writings."]

19 June, 1662. I went to Albury, to visit Mr. Henry Howard, soon after he
had procured the Dukedom to be restored. This gentleman had now
compounded a debt of £200,000, contracted by his grandfather. I was much
obliged to that great virtuoso, and to this young gentleman, with whom I
stayed a fortnight.

2d July, 1662. We hunted and killed a buck in the park, Mr. Howard
inviting most of the gentlemen of the country near him.

3d July, 1662. My wife met me at Woodcot, whither Mr. Howard accompanied
me to see my son John, who had been much brought up among Mr. Howard's
children at Arundel House, till, for fear of their perverting him in the
Catholic religion, I was forced to take him home.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

8th July, 1662. To London, to take leave of the Duke and Duchess of
Ormond, going then into Ireland with an extraordinary retinue.

13th July, 1662. Spent some time with the Lord Chancellor, where I had
discourse with my Lord Willoughby, Governor of Barbadoes, concerning
divers particulars of that colony.

28th July, 1662. His Majesty going to sea to meet the Queen-Mother, now
coming again for England, met with such ill weather as greatly endangered
him. I went to Greenwich, to wait on the Queen, now landed.

30th July, 1662. To London, where was a meeting about Charitable Uses,
and particularly to inquire how the city had disposed of the revenues of
Gresham College, and why the salaries of the professors there were no
better improved. I was on this commission, with divers Bishops and Lords
of the Council; but little was the progress we could make.

31st July, 1662. I sat with the Commissioners about reforming buildings
and streets of London, and we ordered the paving of the way from St.
James's North, which was a quagmire, and also of the Haymarket about
Piqudillo [Piccadilly], and agreed upon instructions to be printed and
published for the better keeping the streets clean.

1st August, 1662. Mr. H. Howard, his brothers Charles, Edward, Bernard,
Philip,[73] now the Queen's Almoner (all brothers of the Duke of Norfolk,
still in Italy), came with a great train, and dined with me; Mr. H.
Howard leaving with me his eldest and youngest sons, Henry and Thomas,
for three or four days, my son, John, having been sometime bred up in
their father's house.

    [Footnote 73: Since Cardinal at Rome. "Evelyn's Note."]

4th August, 1662. Came to see me the old Countess of Devonshire, with
that excellent and worthy person, my Lord her son, from Roehampton.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th August, 1662. To London, and next day to Hampton Court, about my
purchase, and took leave of Sir R. Fanshawe, now going Ambassador to
Portugal.

13th August, 1662. Our Charter being now passed under the broad Seal,
constituting us a corporation under the name of the Royal Society for the
improvement of natural knowledge by experiment, was this day read and was
all that was done this afternoon, being very large.

14th August, 1662. I sat on the commission for Charitable Uses, the Lord
Mayor and others of the Mercers' Company being summoned, to answer some
complaints of the Professors, grounded on a clause in the will of Sir
Thomas Gresham, the founder.

This afternoon, the Queen-Mother, with the Earl of St. Alban's and many
great ladies and persons, was pleased to honor my poor villa with her
presence, and to accept of a collation. She was exceedingly pleased, and
staid till very late in the evening.

15th August, 1662. Came my Lord Chancellor (the Earl of Clarendon) and
his lady, his purse and mace borne before him, to visit me. They were
likewise collationed with us, and were very merry. They had all been our
old acquaintance in exile, and indeed this great person had ever been my
friend. His son, Lord Cornbury, was here, too.

17th August, 1662. Being the Sunday when the Common Prayer Book, reformed
and ordered to be used for the future, was appointed to be read, and the
solemn League and Covenant to be abjured by all the incumbents of England
under penalty of losing their livings; our vicar read it this morning.

20th August, 1662. There were strong guards in the city this day,
apprehending some tumults, many of the Presbyterian ministers not
conforming. I dined with the Vice-Chamberlain, and then went to see the
Queen-Mother, who was pleased to give me many thanks for the
entertainment she received at my house, when she recounted to me many
observable stories of the sagacity of some dogs she formerly had.

21st August, 1662. I was admitted and then sworn one of the Council of
the Royal Society, being nominated in his Majesty's original grant to be
of this Council for the regulation of the Society, and making laws and
statutes conducible to its establishment and progress, for which we now
set apart every Wednesday morning till they were all finished. Lord
Viscount Brouncker (that excellent mathematician) was also by his
Majesty, our founder, nominated our first President. The King gave us the
arms of England to be borne in a canton in our arms, and sent us a mace
of silver gilt, of the same fashion and size as those carried before his
Majesty, to be borne before our president on meeting days. It was brought
by Sir Gilbert Talbot, master of his Majesty's jewel house.

22d August, 1662. I dined with my Lord Brouncker and Sir Robert Murray,
and then went to consult about a newly modeled ship at Lambeth, the
intention being to reduce that art to as certain a method as any other
part of architecture.

23d August, 1662. I was spectator of the most magnificent triumph that
ever floated on the Thames, considering the innumerable boats and
vessels, dressed and adorned with all imaginable pomp, but, above all,
the thrones, arches, pageants, and other representations, stately barges
of the Lord Mayor and companies, with various inventions, music, and
peals of ordnance both from the vessels and the shore, going to meet and
conduct the new Queen from Hampton Court to Whitehall, at the first time
of her coming to town. In my opinion, it far exceeded all the Venetian
Bucentoras, etc., on the Ascension, when they go to espouse the Adriatic.
His Majesty and the Queen came in an antique-shaped open vessel, covered
with a state, or canopy, of cloth of gold, made in form of a cupola,
supported with high Corinthian pillars, wreathed with flowers, festoons
and garlands. I was in our newly built vessel, sailing among them.

29th August, 1662. The Council and Fellows of the Royal Society went in a
body to Whitehall, to acknowledge his Majesty's royal grace in granting
our Charter, and vouchsafing to be himself our founder; when the
President made an eloquent speech, to which his Majesty gave a gracious
reply and we all kissed his hand. Next day we went in like manner with
our address to my Lord Chancellor, who had much promoted our patent: he
received us with extraordinary favor. In the evening I went to the
Queen-Mother's Court, and had much discourse with her.

1st September, 1662. Being invited by Lord Berkeley, I went to Durdans,
where dined his Majesty, the Queen, Duke, Duchess, Prince Rupert, Prince
Edward, and abundance of noblemen. I went, after dinner, to visit my
brother of Woodcot, my sister having been delivered of a son a little
before, but who had now been two days dead.

4th September, 1662. Commission for Charitable Uses, my Lord Mayor and
Aldermen being again summoned, and the improvements of Sir Thomas
Gresham's estate examined. There were present the Bishop of London, the
Lord Chief Justice, and the King's attorney.

6th September, 1662. Dined with me Sir Edward Walker, Garter
King-at-Arms, Mr. Slingsby, master of the Mint, and several others.

17th September, 1662. We now resolved that the Arms of the Society should
be a field argent, with a canton of the arms of England; the supporters
two talbots argent; crest, an eagle Or holding a shield with the like
arms of England, viz, three lions. The words "_Nullius in verbâ_." It was
presented to his Majesty for his approbation, and orders given to Garter
King-at-Arms to pass the diploma of their office for it.

20th September, 1662. I presented a petition to his Majesty about my own
concerns, and afterward accompanied him to Monsieur Febure his chemist
(and who had formerly been my master in Paris), to see his accurate
preparation for the composing Sir Walter Raleigh's rare cordial: he made
a learned discourse before his Majesty in French on each ingredient.

27th September, 1662. Came to visit me Sir George Saville, grandson to
the learned Sir Henry Saville, who published St. Chrysostom. Sir George
was a witty gentleman, if not a little too prompt and daring.

3d October, 1662. I was invited to the College of Physicians, where Dr.
Meret, a learned man and library-keeper, showed me the library, theater
for anatomy, and divers natural curiosities; the statue and epigram under
it of that renowned physician, Dr. Harvey, discoverer of the circulation
of the blood. There I saw Dr. Gilbert, Sir William Paddy's and other
pictures of men famous in their faculty.

Visited Mr. Wright, a Scotchman, who had lived long at Rome, and was
esteemed a good painter. The pictures of the Judges at Guildhall are of
his hand, and so are some pieces in Whitehall, as the roof in his
Majesty's old bedchamber, being Astræa, the St. Catherine, and a
chimney-piece in the Queen's privy chamber; but his best, in my opinion,
is Lacy, the famous Roscius or comedian, whom he has painted in three
dresses, as a gallant, a Presbyterian minister, and a Scotch highlander
in his plaid. It is in his Majesty's dining room at Windsor. He had at
his house an excellent collection, especially that small piece of
Correggio, Scotus of de la Marca, a design of Paulo; and, above all,
those ruins of Polydore, with some good agates and medals, especially a
Scipio, and a Cæsar's head of gold.

15th October, 1662. I this day delivered my "Discourse concerning Forest
Trees" to the Society, upon occasion of certain queries sent to us by the
Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy, being the first book that was
printed by order of the Society, and by their printer, since it was a
corporation.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th October, 1662. I saw "_Volpone_" acted at Court before their
Majesties.

21st October, 1662. To the Queen-Mother's Court, where her Majesty
related to us divers passages of her escapes during the Rebellion and
wars in England.

28th October, 1662. To Court in the evening where the Queen-Mother, the
Queen-Consort, and his Majesty being advertised of some disturbance,
forbore to go to the Lord Mayor's show and feast appointed next day, the
new Queen not having yet seen that triumph.

29th October, 1662. Was my Lord Mayor's show, with a number of sumptuous
pageants, speeches, and verses. I was standing in a house in Cheapside
against the place prepared for their Majesties. The Prince and heir of
Denmark was there, but not our King. There were also the maids of honor.
I went to Court this evening, and had much discourse with Dr. Basiers,
one of his Majesty's chaplains, the great traveler, who showed me the
syngraphs and original subscriptions of divers eastern patriarchs and
Asian churches to our confession.

4th November, 1662. I was invited to the wedding of the daughter of Sir
George Carteret (The Treasurer of the Navy and King's Vice-Chamberlain),
married to Sir Nicholas Slaning, Knight of the Bath, by the Bishop of
London, in the Savoy chapel; after which was an extraordinary feast.

5th November, 1662. The Council of the Royal Society met to amend the
Statutes, and dined together; afterward meeting at Gresham College, where
was a discourse suggested by me, concerning planting his Majesty's Forest
of Dean with oak, now so much exhausted of the choicest ship timber in
the world.

20th November, 1662. Dined with the Comptroller, Sir Hugh Pollard;
afterward saw "The Young Admiral" acted before the King.

21st November, 1662. Spent the evening at Court, Sir Kenelm Digby giving
me great thanks for my "Sylva."

[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1662. Went to London to see the entrance of the Russian
Ambassador, whom his Majesty ordered to be received with much state, the
Emperor not only having been kind to his Majesty in his distress, but
banishing all commerce with our nation during the Rebellion.

First, the city companies and trained bands were all in their stations:
his Majesty's army and guards in great order. His Excellency came in a
very rich coach, with some of his chief attendants; many of the rest on
horseback, clad in their vests, after the Eastern manner, rich furs,
caps, and carrying the presents, some carrying hawks, furs, teeth, bows,
etc. It was a very magnificent show.

I dined with the Master of the Mint, where was old Sir Ralph Freeman;[74]
passing my evening at the Queen-Mother's Court; at night, saw acted "The
Committee," a ridiculous play of Sir R. Howard, where the mimic, Lacy,
acted the Irish footman to admiration.

    [Footnote 74: Of Betchworth, in Surrey.]

30th November, 1662. St. Andrew's day. Invited by the Dean of Westminster
to his consecration dinner and ceremony, on his being made Bishop of
Worcester. Dr. Bolton preached in the Abbey Church; then followed the
consecration by the Bishops of London, Chichester, Winchester, Salisbury,
etc. After this, was one of the most plentiful and magnificent dinners
that in my life I ever saw; it cost near £600 as I was informed. Here
were the judges, nobility, clergy, and gentlemen innumerable, this Bishop
being universally beloved for his sweet and gentle disposition. He was
author of those Characters which go under the name of Blount. He
translated his late Majesty's "Icon" into Latin, was Clerk of his Closet,
Chaplain, Dean of Westminster, and yet a most humble, meek, and cheerful
man, an excellent scholar, and rare preacher. I had the honor to be loved
by him. He married me at Paris, during his Majesty's and the Church's
exile. When I took leave of him, he brought me to the cloisters in his
episcopal habit. I then went to prayers at Whitehall, where I passed that
evening.

1st December, 1662. Having seen the strange and wonderful dexterity of
the sliders on the new canal in St. James's Park, performed before their
Majesties by divers gentlemen and others with skates, after the manner of
the Hollanders, with what swiftness they pass, how suddenly they stop in
full career upon the ice; I went home by water, but not without exceeding
difficulty, the Thames being frozen, great flakes of ice encompassing our
boat.

17th December, 1662, I saw acted before the King "The Law against
Lovers."[75]

    [Footnote 75: By Sir William Davenant, a hotch-potch out of "Measure
    for Measure" and "Much Ado about Nothing."]

21st December, 1662. One of his Majesty's chaplains preached; after
which, instead of the ancient, grave, and solemn wind music accompanying
the organ, was introduced a concert of twenty-four violins between every
pause, after the French fantastical light way, better suiting a tavern,
or playhouse, than a church. This was the first time of change, and now
we no more heard the cornet which gave life to the organ; that instrument
quite left off in which the English were so skillful. I dined at Mr.
Povey's, where I talked with Cromer, a great musician.

23d December, 1662. I went with Sir George Tuke, to hear the comedians
con and repeat his new comedy, "The Adventures of Five Hours," a play
whose plot was taken out of the famous Spanish poet, Calderon.

27th December, 1662. I visited Sir Theophilus Biddulph.

29th December, 1662. Saw the audience of the Muscovy Ambassador, which
was with extraordinary state, his retinue being numerous, all clad in
vests of several colors, with buskins, after the Eastern manner! their
caps of fur; tunics, richly embroidered with gold and pearls, made a
glorious show. The King being seated under a canopy in the Banqueting
House, the Secretary of the Embassy went before the Ambassador in a grave
march, holding up his master's letters of credence in a crimson taffeta
scarf before his forehead. The Ambassador then delivered it with a
profound reverence to the King, who gave it to our Secretary of State: it
was written in a long and lofty style. Then came in the presents, borne
by 165 of his retinue, consisting of mantles and other large pieces lined
with sable, black fox, and ermine; Persian carpets, the ground cloth of
gold and velvet; hawks, such as they said never came the like; horses
said to be Persian; bows and arrows, etc. These borne by so long a train
rendered it very extraordinary. Wind music played all the while in the
galleries above. This finished, the Ambassador was conveyed by the master
of the ceremonies to York House, where he was treated with a banquet,
which cost £200, as I was assured.

7th January, 1663. At night I saw the ball, in which his Majesty danced
with several great ladies.

8th January, 1663. I went to see my kinsman, Sir George Tuke's, comedy
acted at the Duke's theater, which took so universally, that it was acted
for some weeks every day, and it was believed it would be worth to the
comedians £400 or £500. The plot was incomparable; but the language stiff
and formal.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th January, 1663. I saw a ball again at Court, danced by the King, the
Duke, and ladies, in great pomp.

21st January, 1663. Dined at Mr. Treasurer's, of the Household, Sir
Charles Berkeley's, where were the Earl of Oxford, Lord Bellassis, Lord
Gerard, Sir Andrew Scrope, Sir William Coventry, Dr. Fraser, Mr. Windham,
and others.

5th February, 1663. I saw "The Wild Gallant," a comedy;[76] and was at
the great ball at Court, where his Majesty, the Queen, etc., danced.

    [Footnote 76: By Dryden. It was unsuccessful on the first
    representation, but was subsequently altered to the form in which it
    now appears.]

6th February, 1663. Dined at my Lord Mayor's, Sir John Robinson,
Lieutenant of the Tower.

15th February, 1663. This night some villains broke into my house and
study below, and robbed me to the value of £60 in plate, money and
goods:--this being the third time I have been thus plundered.

26th March, 1663. I sat at the Commission of Sewers, where was a great
case pleaded by his Majesty's counsel; he having built a wall over a
water course, denied the jurisdiction of the Court. The verdict went for
the plaintiff.[77]

    [Footnote 77: That is against the King.]

30th April, 1663. Came his Majesty to honor my poor villa with his
presence, viewing the gardens, and even every room of the house, and was
pleased to take a small refreshment. There were with him the Duke of
Richmond, Earl of St. Alban's, Lord Lauderdale, and several persons of
quality.

14th May, 1663. Dined with my Lord Mordaunt, and thence went to Barnes,
to visit my excellent and ingenious friend, Abraham Cowley.

17th May, 1663. I saluted the old Bishop of Durham, Dr. Cosin, to whom I
had been kind, and assisted in his exile; but which he little remembered
in his greatness.

29th May, 1663. Dr. Creighton preached his extravagant sermon at St.
Margaret's, before the House of Commons.

30th May, 1663. This morning was passed my lease of Sayes Court from the
Crown, for the finishing of which I had been obliged to make such
frequent journeys to London. I returned this evening, having seen the
Russian Ambassador take leave of their Majesties with great solemnity.

2d July, 1663. I saw the great Masque at Court, and lay that night at
Arundel House.

4th July, 1663. I saw his Majesty's Guards, being of horse and foot
4,000, led by the General, the Duke of Albemarle, in extraordinary
equipage and gallantry, consisting of gentlemen of quality and veteran
soldiers, excellently clad, mounted, and ordered, drawn up in battalia
before their Majesties in Hyde Park, where the old Earl of Cleveland
trailed a pike, and led the right-hand file in a foot company, commanded
by the Lord Wentworth, his son; a worthy spectacle and example, being
both of them old and valiant soldiers. This was to show the French
Ambassador, Monsieur Comminges; there being a great assembly of coaches,
etc., in the park.

7th July, 1663. Dined at the Comptroller's; after dinner we met at the
Commission about the streets, and to regulate hackney coaches, also to
make up our accounts to pass the Exchequer.

16th July, 1663. A most extraordinary wet and cold season.

Sir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy, had now married his daughter,
Caroline, to Sir Thomas Scott, of Scott's Hall, in Kent. This gentleman
was thought to be the son of Prince Rupert.

2d August, 1663. This evening I accompanied Mr. Treasurer and
Vice-Chamberlain Carteret to his lately married son-in-law's, Sir Thomas
Scott, to Scott's Hall. We took barge as far as Gravesend, and thence by
post to Rochester, whence in coach and six horses to Scott's Hall; a
right noble seat, uniformly built, with a handsome gallery. It stands in
a park well stored, the land fat and good. We were exceedingly feasted by
the young knight, and in his pretty chapel heard an excellent sermon by
his chaplain. In the afternoon, preached the learned Sir Norton
Knatchbull (who has a noble seat hard by, and a plantation of stately fir
trees). In the churchyard of the parish church I measured an overgrown
yew tree, that was eighteen of my paces in compass, out of some branches
of which, torn off by the winds, were sawed divers goodly planks.

10th August, 1663. We returned by Sir Norton's, whose house is likewise
in a park. This gentleman is a worthy person, and learned critic,
especially in Greek and Hebrew. Passing by Chatham, we saw his Majesty's
Royal Navy, and dined at Commissioner Pett's,[78] master-builder there,
who showed me his study and models, with other curiosities belonging to
his art. He is esteemed for the most skillful shipbuilder in the world.
He hath a pretty garden and banqueting house, pots, statues, cypresses,
resembling some villas about Rome. After a great feast we rode post to
Gravesend, and, sending the coach to London, came by barge home that
night.

    [Footnote 78: A monument to him in Deptford Church bears a most
    pompous inscription: "_Qui fuit patriæ decus, patriæ suæ magnum
    munimentum_;" to the effect that he had not only restored our naval
    affairs, but he invented that excellent and new ornament of the Navy
    which we call Frigate, formidable to our enemies, to us most useful
    and safe: he was to be esteemed, indeed, by this invention, the Noah
    of his age, which, like another Ark, had snatched from shipwreck our
    rights and our dominion of the seas.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th August, 1663. To London, to see my Lord Chancellor, where I had
discourse with my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of
Winchester, who enjoined me to write to Dr. Pierce, President of Magdalen
College, Oxford, about a letter sent him by Dr. Goffe, a Romish
Oratorian, concerning an answer to Dean Cressy's late book.

20th August, 1663. I dined at the Comptroller's [of the Household] with
the Earl of Oxford and Mr. Ashburnham; it was said it should be the last
of the public diets, or tables, at Court, it being determined to put down
the old hospitality, at which was great murmuring, considering his
Majesty's vast revenue and the plenty of the nation. Hence, I went to sit
in a Committee, to consider about the regulation of the Mint at the
Tower; in which some small progress was made.

27th August, 1663. Dined at Sir Philip Warwick's, Secretary to my Lord
Treasurer, who showed me the accounts and other private matters relating
to the revenue. Thence, to the Commissioners of the Mint, particularly
about coinage, and bringing his Majesty's rate from fifteen to ten
shillings for every pound weight of gold.

31st August, 1663. I was invited to the translation of Dr. Sheldon,
Bishop of London, from that see to Canterbury, the ceremony performed at
Lambeth. First, went his Grace's mace bearer, steward, treasurer,
comptroller, all in their gowns, and with white staves; next, the bishops
in their habits, eight in number; Dr. Sweate, Dean of the Arches, Dr.
Exton, Judge of the Admiralty, Sir William Merick, Judge of the
Prerogative Court, with divers advocates in scarlet. After divine service
in the chapel, performed with music extraordinary, Dr. French and Dr.
Stradling (his Grace's chaplains) said prayers. The Archbishop in a
private room looking into the chapel, the bishops, who were
commissioners, went up to a table placed before the altar, and sat round
it in chairs. Then Dr. Chaworth presented the commission under the broad
seal to the Bishop of Winchester, and it was read by Dr. Sweate. After
which, the Vicar-General went to the vestry, and brought his Grace into
the chapel, his other officers marching before. He being presented to the
Commissioners, was seated in a great armchair at one end of the table,
when the definitive sentence was read by the Bishop of Winchester, and
subscribed by all the bishops, and proclamation was three times made at
the chapel door, which was then set open for any to enter, and give their
exceptions; if any they had. This done, we all went to dinner in the
great hall to a mighty feast. There were present all the nobility in
town, the Lord Mayor of London, Sheriffs, Duke of Albemarle, etc. My Lord
Archbishop did in particular most civilly welcome me. So going to visit
my Lady Needham, who lived at Lambeth, I went over to London.

10th September, 1663. I dined with Mr. Treasurer of the Navy, where,
sitting by Mr. Secretary Morice, we had much discourse about books and
authors, he being a learned man, and had a good collection.

24th October, 1663. Mr. Edward Phillips came to be my son's preceptor:
this gentleman was nephew to Milton, who wrote against Salmasius's
"_Defensio_"; but was not at all infected with his principles, though
brought up by him.

5th November, 1663. Dr. South, my Lord Chancellor's chaplain, preached at
Westminster Abbey an excellent discourse concerning obedience to
magistrates, against the pontificians and sectaries. I afterward dined at
Sir Philip Warwick's, where was much company.

6th November, 1663. To Court, to get Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, off
from being Sheriff of Surrey.

30th November, 1663. Was the first anniversary of our Society for the
choice of new officers, according to the tenor of our patent and
institution. It being St. Andrew's day, who was our patron, each fellow
wore a St. Andrew's cross of ribbon on the crown of his hat. After the
election we dined together, his Majesty sending us venison.

16th December, 1663. To our Society, where Mr. P. Balle, our treasurer at
the late election, presented the Society with an iron chest, having three
locks, and in it £100 as a gift.

18th December, 1663. Dined with the gentlemen of his Majesty's bedchamber
at Whitehall.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d January, 1663-64. To Barn Elms, to see Abraham Cowley after his
sickness; and returned that evening to London.

4th February, 1664. Dined at Sir Philip Warwick's; thence, to Court,
where I had discourse with the King about an invention of glass-grenades,
and several other subjects.

5th February, 1664. I saw "The Indian Queen" acted, a tragedy well
written,[79] so beautiful with rich scenes as the like had never been
seen here, or haply (except rarely) elsewhere on a mercenary theater.

    [Footnote 79: By Sir Robert Howard and Dryden.]

16th February, 1664. I presented my "Sylva" to the Society; and next day
to his Majesty, to whom it was dedicated; also to the Lord Treasurer and
the Lord Chancellor.

24th February, 1664. My Lord George Berkeley, of Durdans, and Sir Samuel
Tuke came to visit me. We went on board Sir William Petty's
double-bottomed vessel, and so to London.

26th February, 1664. Dined with my Lord Chancellor; and thence to Court,
where I had great thanks for my "Sylva," and long discourse with the King
of divers particulars.

2d March, 1664. Went to London to distribute some of my books among
friends.

4th March, 1664. Came to dine with me the Earl of Lauderdale, his
Majesty's great favorite, and Secretary of Scotland; the Earl of Teviot;
my Lord Viscount Brouncker, President of the Royal Society; Dr. Wilkins,
Dean of Ripon; Sir Robert Murray, and Mr. Hooke, Curator to the Society.

This spring I planted the Home field and West field about Sayes Court
with elms, being the same year that the elms were planted by his Majesty
in Greenwich Park.

9th March, 1664. I went to the Tower, to sit in commission about
regulating the Mint; and now it was that the fine new-milled coin, both
of white money and guineas, was established.

26th March, 1664. It pleased God to take away my son, Richard, now a
month old, yet without any sickness of danger perceivably, being to all
appearance a most likely child; we suspected much the nurse had overlain
him; to our extreme sorrow, being now again reduced to one: but God's
will be done.

29th March, 1664. After evening prayers, was my child buried near the
rest of his brothers--my very dear children.

27th April, 1664. Saw a facetious comedy, called "Love in a Tub"; and
supped at Mr. Secretary Bennett's.

3d May, 1664. Came the Earl of Kent, my kinsman, and his Lady, to visit
us.

5th May, 1664. Went with some company a journey of pleasure on the water,
in a barge, with music, and at Mortlake had a great banquet, returning
late. The occasion was, Sir Robert Carr now courting Mrs. Bennett, sister
to the Secretary of State.

6th May, 1664. Went to see Mr. Wright the painter's collection of rare
shells, etc.

8th June, 1664. To our Society, to which his Majesty had sent that
wonderful horn of the fish which struck a dangerous hole in the keel of a
ship in the India sea, which, being broken off with the violence of the
fish, and left in the timber, preserved it from foundering.

9th June, 1664. Sir Samuel Tuke[80] being this morning married to a lady,
kinswoman to my Lord Arundel of Wardour, by the Queen's Lord Almoner, L.
Aubigny in St. James's chapel, solemnized his wedding night at my house
with much company.

    [Footnote 80: A Roman Catholic.]

22d June, 1664. One Tomson, a Jesuit, showed me such a collection of
rarities, sent from the Jesuits of Japan and China to their Order at
Paris, as a present to be reserved in their repository, but brought to
London by the East India ships for them, as in my life I had not seen.
The chief things were, rhinoceros's horns; glorious vests, wrought and
embroidered on cloth of gold, but with such lively colors, that for
splendor and vividness we have nothing in Europe that approaches it; a
girdle studded with agates and rubies of great value and size; knives, of
so keen an edge as one could not touch them, nor was the metal of our
color, but more pale and livid; fans, like those our ladies use, but much
larger, and with long handles curiously carved and filled with Chinese
characters; a sort of paper very broad, thin, and fine, like abortive
parchment, and exquisitely polished, of an amber yellow, exceedingly
glorious and pretty to look on, and seeming to be like that which my
Lord Verulam describes in his "_Nova Atlantis_"; several other sorts of
paper, some written, others printed; prints of landscapes, their idols,
saints, pagods, of most ugly serpentine monstrous and hideous shapes, to
which they paid devotion; pictures of men and countries, rarely painted
on a sort of gummed calico, transparent as glass; flowers, trees, beasts,
birds, etc., excellently wrought in a kind of sleeve silk, very natural;
divers drugs that our druggists and physicians could make nothing of,
especially one which the Jesuit called _Lac Tigridis_: it looked like a
fungus, but was weighty like metal, yet was a concretion, or coagulation,
of some other matter; several book MSS.; a grammar of the language
written in Spanish; with innumerable other rarities.

1st July, 1664. Went to see Mr. Povey's elegant house in Lincoln's-Inn
Fields, where the perspective in his court, painted by Streeter, is
indeed excellent, with the vases in imitation of porphyry, and fountains;
the inlaying of his closet; above all, his pretty cellar and ranging of
his wine bottles.

7th July, 1664. To Court, where I subscribed to Sir Arthur Slingsby's
lottery, a desperate debt owing me long since in Paris.

14th July, 1664. I went to take leave of the two Mr. Howards, now going
to Paris, and brought them as far as Bromley; thence to Eltham, to see
Sir John Shaw's new house, now building; the place is pleasant, if not
too wet, but the house not well contrived; especially the roof and rooms
too low pitched, and the kitchen where the cellars should be; the
orangery and aviary handsome, and a very large plantation about it.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th July, 1664. To London, to see the event of the lottery which his
Majesty had permitted Sir Arthur Slingsby to set up for one day in the
Banqueting House, at Whitehall; I gaining only a trifle, as well as did
the King, Queen-Consort, and Queen-Mother, for near thirty lots; which
was thought to be contrived very unhandsomely by the master of it, who
was, in truth, a mere shark.

21st July, 1664. I dined with my Lord Treasurer at Southampton House,
where his Lordship used me with singular humanity. I went in the
afternoon to Chelsea, to wait on the Duke of Ormond, and returned to
London.

28th July, 1664. Came to see me Monsieur Zuylichen, Secretary to the
Prince of Orange, an excellent Latin poet, a rare lutinist, with Monsieur
Oudart.

3d August, 1664. To London; a concert of excellent musicians, especially
one Mr. Berkenshaw, that rare artist, who invented a mathematical way of
composure very extraordinary, true as to the exact rules of art, but
without much harmony.

8th August, 1664. Came the sad and unexpected news of the death of Lady
Cotton, wife to my brother George, a most excellent lady.

9th August, 1664. Went with my brother Richard to Wotton, to visit and
comfort my disconsolate brother; and on the 13th saw my friend, Mr.
Charles Howard, at Dipden, near Dorking.

16th August, 1664. I went to see Sir William Ducie's house at Charlton;
which he purchased of my excellent friend, Sir Henry Newton, now nobly
furnished.

22d August, 1664. I went from London to Wotton, to assist at the funeral
of my sister-in-law, the Lady Cotton, buried in our dormitory there, she
being put up in lead. Dr. Owen made a profitable and pathetic discourse,
concluding with an eulogy of that virtuous, pious, and deserving lady. It
was a very solemn funeral, with about fifty mourners. I came back next
day with my wife to London.

2d September, 1664. Came Constantine Huygens, Signor de Zuylichen, Sir
Robert Morris, Mr. Oudart, Mr. Carew, and other friends, to spend the day
with us.

5th October, 1664. To our Society. There was brought a newly-invented
instrument of music, being a harpsichord with gut-strings, sounding like
a concert of viols with an organ, made vocal by a wheel, and a zone of
parchment that rubbed horizontally against the strings.

6th October, 1664. I heard the anniversary oration in praise of Dr.
Harvey, in the Anatomy Theatre in the College of Physicians; after which
I was invited by Dr. Alston, the President, to a magnificent feast.

7th October, 1664. I dined at Sir Nicholas Strood's, one of the Masters
of Chancery, in Great St. Bartholomew's; passing the evening at
Whitehall, with the Queen, etc.

8th October, 1664. Sir William Curtius, his Majesty's Resident in
Germany, came to visit me; he was a wise and learned gentleman, and, as
he told me, scholar to Henry Alstedius, the Encyclopedist.

15th October, 1664. Dined at the Lord Chancellor's, where was the Duke of
Ormond, Earl of Cork, and Bishop of Winchester. After dinner, my Lord
Chancellor and his lady carried me in their coach to see their palace
(for he now lived at Worcester-House in the Strand), building at the
upper end of St. James's street, and to project the garden. In the
evening, I presented him with my book on Architecture,[81] as before I
had done to his Majesty and the Queen-Mother. His lordship caused me to
stay with him in his bedchamber, discoursing of several matters very
late, even till he was going into his bed.

    originally written in French, by Roland Freart, Sieur de Chambray,"
    and translated by Evelyn. See his "Miscellaneous Writings."]

17th October, 1664. I went with my Lord Viscount Cornbury, to Cornbury,
in Oxfordshire, to assist him in the planting of the park, and bear him
company, with Mr. Belin and Mr. May, in a coach with six horses; dined at
Uxbridge, lay at Wycombe.

[Sidenote: OXFORD]

18th October, 1664. At Oxford. Went through Woodstock, where we beheld
the destruction of that royal seat and park by the late rebels, and
arrived that evening at Cornbury, a house lately built by the Earl of
Denbigh, in the middle of a sweet park, walled with a dry wall. The house
is of excellent freestone, abounding in that part, (a stone that is fine,
but never sweats, or casts any damp); it is of ample dimensions, has
goodly cellars, the paving of the hall admirable for its close laying. We
designed a handsome chapel that was yet wanting: as Mr. May had the
stables, which indeed are very fair, having set out the walks in the
parks and gardens. The lodge is a pretty solitude, and the ponds very
convenient; the park well stored.

20th October, 1664. Hence, to see the famous wells, natural and
artificial grots and fountains, called Bushell's Wells, at Enstone. This
Bushell had been Secretary to my Lord Verulam. It is an extraordinary
solitude. There he had two mummies; a grot where he lay in a hammock,
like an Indian. Hence, we went to Dichley, an ancient seat of the Lees,
now Sir Henry Lee's; it is a low ancient timber-house, with a pretty
bowling-green. My Lady gave us an extraordinary dinner. This gentleman's
mother was Countess of Rochester, who was also there, and Sir Walter St.
John. There were some pictures of their ancestors, not ill painted; the
great-grandfather had been Knight of the Garter; there was a picture of a
Pope, and our Savior's head. So we returned to Cornbury.

24th October, 1664. We dined at Sir Timothy Tyrill's at Shotover. This
gentleman married the daughter and heir of Dr. James Usher, Archbishop of
Armagh, that learned prelate. There is here in the grove a fountain of
the coldest water I ever felt, and very clear. His plantation of oaks and
other timber is very commendable. We went in the evening to Oxford, lay
at Dr. Hyde's, principal of Magdalen-Hall (related to the Lord
Chancellor), brother to the Lord Chief Justice and that Sir Henry Hyde,
who lost his head for his loyalty. We were handsomely entertained two
days. The Vice-Chancellor, who with Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ Church, the
learned Dr. Barlow, Warden of Queen's, and several heads of houses, came
to visit Lord Cornbury (his father being now Chancellor of the
University), and next day invited us all to dinner. I went to visit Mr.
Boyle (now here), whom I found with Dr. Wallis and Dr. Christopher Wren,
in the tower of the schools, with an inverted tube, or telescope,
observing the discus of the sun for the passing of Mercury that day
before it; but the latitude was so great that nothing appeared; so we
went to see the rarities in the library, where the keepers showed me my
name among the benefactors. They have a cabinet of some medals, and
pictures of the muscular parts of man's body. Thence, to the new theater,
now building at an exceeding and royal expense by the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury [Sheldon], to keep the Acts in for the future, till now being
in St. Mary's Church. The foundation had been newly laid, and the whole
designed by that incomparable genius my worthy friend, Dr. Christopher
Wren, who showed me the model, not disdaining my advice in some
particulars. Thence, to see the picture on the wall over the altar of All
Souls, being the largest piece of fresco painting (or rather in imitation
of it, for it is in oil of turpentine) in England, not ill designed by
the hand of one Fuller; yet I fear it will not hold long. It seems too
full of nakeds for a chapel.

Thence, to New College, and the painting of Magdalen chapel, which is on
blue cloth in _chiar oscuro_, by one Greenborow, being a _Coena
Domini_, and a "Last Judgment" on the wall by Fuller, as in the other,
but somewhat varied.

Next to Wadham, and the Physic Garden, where were two large locust trees,
and as many platani (plane trees), and some rare plants under the culture
of old Bobart.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1664. We came back to Beaconsfield; next day to London,
where we dined at the Lord Chancellor's, with my Lord Bellasis.

27th October, 1664. Being casually in the privy gallery at Whitehall, his
Majesty gave me thanks before divers lords and noblemen for my book of
"Architecture," and again for my "_Sylva_" saying they were the best
designed and useful for the matter and subject, the best printed and
designed (meaning the _taille-douces_ of the Parallel of Architecture)
that he had seen. He then caused me to follow him alone to one of the
windows, and asked me if I had any paper about me unwritten, and a
crayon; I presented him with both, and then laying it on the
window-stool, he with his own hands designed to me the plot for the
future building of Whitehall, together with the rooms of state, and other
particulars. After this, he talked with me of several matters, asking my
advice, in which I find his Majesty had an extraordinary talent becoming
a magnificent prince.

The same day at Council, there being Commissioners to be made to take
care of such sick and wounded and prisoners of war, as might be expected
upon occasion of a succeeding war and action at sea, war being already
declared against the Hollanders, his Majesty was pleased to nominate me
to be one, with three other gentlemen, Parliament men, viz, Sir William
Doily, Knt. and Bart., Sir Thomas Clifford, and Bullein Rheymes, Esq.;
with a salary of £1,200 a year among us, besides extraordinaries for our
care and attention in time of station, each of us being appointed to a
particular district, mine falling out to be Kent and Sussex, with power
to constitute officers, physicians, chirurgeons, provost-marshals, and to
dispose of half of the hospitals through England. After the Council, we
kissed his Majesty's hand. At this Council I heard Mr. Solicitor Finch
plead most elegantly for the merchants trading to the Canaries, praying
for a new Charter.

29th October, 1664. Was the most magnificent triumph by water and land of
the Lord Mayor. I dined at Guildhall at the upper table, placed next to
Sir H. Bennett, Secretary of State, opposite to my Lord Chancellor and
the Duke of Buckingham, who sat between Monsieur Comminges, the French
Ambassador, Lord Treasurer, the Dukes of Ormond and Albemarle, Earl of
Manchester, Lord Chamberlain, and the rest of the great officers of
state. My Lord Mayor came twice up to us, first drinking in the golden
goblet his Majesty's health, then the French King's as a compliment to
the Ambassador; we returned my Lord Mayor's health, the trumpets and
drums sounding. The cheer was not to be imagined for the plenty and
rarity, with an infinite number of persons at the tables in that ample
hall. The feast was said to cost £1,000. I slipped away in the crowd, and
came home late.

31st October, 1664. I was this day 44 years of age; for which I returned
thanks to Almighty God, begging his merciful protection for the year to
come.

2d November, 1664. Her Majesty, the Queen-Mother, came across the gallery
in Whitehall to give me thanks for my book of "Architecture," which I had
presented to her, with a compliment that I did by no means deserve.

16th November, 1664. We chose our treasurer, clerks, and messengers, and
appointed our seal, which I ordered should be the good Samaritan, with
this motto, "_Fac similiter_." Painters' Hall was lent us to meet in. In
the great room were divers pictures, some reasonably good, that had been
given to the Company by several of the wardens and masters of the
Company.

23d November, 1664. Our statutes now finished, were read before a full
assembly of the Royal Society.

24th November, 1664. His Majesty was pleased to tell me what the
conference was with the Holland Ambassador, which, as after I found, was
the heads of the speech he made at the reconvention of the Parliament,
which now began.

2d December, 1664. We delivered the Privy Council's letters to the
Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark, that a moiety of the
house should be reserved for such sick and wounded as should from time to
time be sent from the fleet during the war. This being delivered at their
Court, the President and several Aldermen, Governors of that Hospital,
invited us to a great feast in Fishmongers' Hall.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th December, 1664. To London, our last sitting, taking order for our
personal visiting our several districts. I dined at Captain Cocke's (our
treasurer), with that most ingenious gentleman, Matthew Wren, son to the
Bishop of Ely, and Mr. Joseph Williamson, since Secretary of State.

22d December, 1664. I went to the launching of a new ship of two bottoms,
invented by Sir William Petty, on which were various opinions; his
Majesty being present, gave her the name of the "Experiment": so I
returned home, where I found Sir Humphry Winch, who spent the day with
me.

This year I planted the lower grove next the pond at Sayes Court. It was
now exceedingly cold, and a hard, long, frosty season, and the comet was
very visible.

28th December, 1664. Some of my poor neighbors dined with me, and others
of my tenants, according to my annual custom.

31st December, 1664. Set my affairs in order, gave God praise for His
mercies the past year, and prepared for the reception of the Holy
Sacrament, which I partook of the next day, after hearing our minister on
the 4th of Galatians, verses 4, 5, of the mystery of our Blessed Savior's
Incarnation.

THE DIARY OF JOHN EVELYN.


2d January, 1665.

This day was published by me that part of "The Mystery of Jesuitism"
translated and collected by me, though without my name, containing the
Imaginary Heresy, with four letters and other pieces.

4th January, 1665. I went in a coach, it being excessive sharp frost and
snow, toward Dover and other parts of Kent, to settle physicians,
chirurgeons, agents, marshals, and other officers in all the sea ports,
to take care of such as should be set on shore, wounded, sick, or
prisoners, in pursuance of our commission reaching from the North
Foreland, in Kent, to Portsmouth, in Hampshire. The rest of the ports in
England were allotted to the other Commissioners. That evening I came to
Rochester, where I delivered the Privy Council's letter to the Mayor to
receive orders from me.

5th January, 1665. I arrived at Canterbury, and went to the cathedral,
exceedingly well repaired since his Majesty's return.

6th January, 1665. To Dover, where Colonel Stroode, Lieutenant of the
Castle, having received the letter I brought him from the Duke of
Albemarle, made me lodge in it, and I was splendidly treated, assisting
me from place to place. Here I settled my first Deputy. The Mayor and
officers of the Customs were very civil to me.

9th January, 1665. To Deal.--10th. To Sandwich, a pretty town, about two
miles from the sea. The Mayor and officers of the Customs were very
diligent to serve me. I visited the forts in the way, and returned that
night to Canterbury.

11th January, 1665. To Rochester, when I took order to settle officers
at Chatham.

12th January, 1665. To Gravesend, and returned home. A cold, busy, but
not unpleasant journey.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th January, 1665. This night being at Whitehall, his Majesty came to
me standing in the withdrawing-room, and gave me thanks for publishing
"The Mysteries of Jesuitism," which he said he had carried two days in
his pocket, read it, and encouraged me; at which I did not a little
wonder: I suppose Sir Robert Murray had given it to him.

27th January, 1665. Dined at the Lord Chancellor's, who caused me after
dinner to sit two or three hours alone with him in his bedchamber.

2d February, 1665. I saw a Masque performed at Court, by six gentlemen
and six ladies, surprising his Majesty, it being Candlemas day.

8th February, Ash Wednesday, 1665. I visited our prisoners at Chelsea
College, and to examine how the marshal and sutlers behaved. These were
prisoners taken in the war; they only complained that their bread was
too fine. I dined at Sir Henry Herbert's, Master of the Revels.

9th February, 1665. Dined at my Lord Treasurer's, the Earl of
Southampton, in Bloomsbury, where he was building a noble square or
piazza,[1] a little town; his own house stands too low, some noble
rooms, a pretty cedar chapel, a naked garden to the north, but good air.
I had much discourse with his Lordship, whom I found to be a person of
extraordinary parts, but a _valetudinarian_.--I went to St. James's
Park, where I saw various animals, and examined the throat of the
_Onocrotylus_, or pelican, a fowl between a stork and a swan; a
melancholy water-fowl, brought from Astrakhan by the Russian Ambassador;
it was diverting to see how he would toss up and turn a flat fish,
plaice, or flounder, to get it right into his gullet at its lower beak,
which, being filmy, stretches to a prodigious wideness when it devours a
great fish. Here was also a small water-fowl, not bigger than a moorhen,
that went almost quite erect, like the penguin of America; it would eat
as much fish as its whole body weighed; I never saw so unsatiable a
devourer, yet the body did not appear to swell the bigger. The solan
geese here are also great devourers, and are said soon to exhaust all
the fish in a pond. Here was a curious sort of poultry not much
exceeding the size of a tame pigeon, with legs so short as their crops
seemed to touch the earth; a milk-white raven; a stork, which was a
rarity at this season, seeing he was loose, and could fly loftily; two
Balearian cranes, one of which having had one of his legs broken and cut
off above the knee, had a wooden or boxen leg and thigh, with a joint so
accurately made that the creature could walk and use it as well as if it
had been natural; it was made by a soldier. The park was at this time
stored with numerous flocks of several sorts of ordinary and
extraordinary wild fowl, breeding about the Decoy, which for being near
so great a city, and among such a concourse of soldiers and people, is a
singular and diverting thing. There were also deer of several countries,
white; spotted like leopards; antelopes, an elk, red deer, roebucks,
stags, Guinea goats, Arabian sheep, etc. There were withy-pots, or
nests, for the wild fowl to lay their eggs in, a little above the
surface of the water.

    [Footnote 1: The Italians mean simply a square by their _piazzas_.]

23d February, 1665. I was invited to a great feast at Mr. Rich's (a
relation of my wife's, now reader at Lincoln's Inn); where was the Duke
of Monmouth, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishops of London and
Winchester, the Speaker of the House of Commons, divers of the Judges,
and several other great men.

24th February, 1665. Dr. Fell, Canon of Christ Church, preached before
the King, on 15 ch. Romans, v. 2, a very formal discourse, and in blank
verse, according to his manner; however, he is a good man.--Mr. Philips,
preceptor to my son, went to be with the Earl of Pembroke's son, my Lord
Herbert.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d March, 1665. I went with his Majesty into the lobby behind the House
of Lords, where I saw the King and the rest of the Lords robe
themselves, and got into the House of Lords in a corner near the
woolsack, on which the Lord Chancellor sits next below the throne: the
King sat in all the regalia, the crown-imperial on his head, the sceptre
and globe, etc. The Duke of Albemarle bore the sword, the Duke of
Ormond, the cap of dignity. The rest of the Lords robed in their
places:--a most splendid and august convention. Then came the Speaker
and the House of Commons, and at the bar made a speech, and afterward
presented several bills, a nod only passing them, the clerk saying, _Le
Roy le veult_, as to public bills, as to private, _Soit faite commeil
est desirè_. Then, his Majesty made a handsome but short speech,
commanding my Lord Privy Seal to prorogue the Parliament, which he did,
the Chancellor being ill and absent. I had not before seen this
ceremony.

9th March, 1665. I went to receive the poor creatures that were saved
out of the London frigate, blown up by accident, with above 200 men.

29th March, 1665. Went to Goring House, now Mr. Secretary Bennet's,
ill-built, but the place capable of being made a pretty villa. His
Majesty was now finishing the Decoy in the Park.

2d April, 1665. Took order about some prisoners sent from Captain
Allen's ship, taken in the Solomon, viz, the brave men who defended her
so gallantly.

5th April, 1665. Was a day of public humiliation and for success of this
terrible war, begun doubtless at secret instigation of the French to
weaken the States and Protestant interest. Prodigious preparations on
both sides.

6th April, 1665. In the afternoon, I saw acted "_Mustapha_," a tragedy
written by the Earl of Orrery.

11th April, 1665. To London, being now left the only Commissioner to
take all necessary orders how to exchange, remove, and keep prisoners,
dispose of hospitals, etc.; the rest of the Commissioners being gone to
their several districts, in expectation of a sudden engagement.

19th April, 1665. Invited to a great dinner at the Trinity House, where
I had business with the Commissioners of the Navy, and to receive the
second £5,000, impressed for the service of the sick and wounded
prisoners.

20th April, 1665. To Whitehall, to the King, who called me into his
bedchamber as he was dressing, to whom, I showed the letter written to
me from the Duke of York from the fleet, giving me notice of young
Evertzen, and some considerable commanders newly taken in fight with the
Dartmouth and Diamond frigates, whom he had sent me as prisoners at war;
I went to know of his Majesty how he would have me treat them, when he
commanded me to bring the young captain to him, and to take the word of
the Dutch Ambassador (who yet remained here) for the other, that he
should render himself to me whenever I called on him, and not stir
without leave. Upon which I desired more guards, the prison being
Chelsea House. I went also to Lord Arlington (the Secretary Bennet
lately made a Lord) about other business. Dined at my Lord Chancellor's;
none with him but Sir Sackville Crowe, formerly Ambassador at
Constantinople; we were very cheerful and merry.

24th April, 1665. I presented young Captain Evertzen (eldest son of
Cornelius, Vice-Admiral of Zealand and nephew of John, now Admiral, a
most valiant person) to his Majesty in his bed-chamber. The King gave
him his hand to kiss, and restored him his liberty; asked many questions
concerning the fight (it being the first blood drawn), his Majesty
remembering the many civilities he had formerly received from his
relations abroad, who had now so much interest in that considerable
Province. Then, I was commanded to go with him to the Holland
Ambassador, where he was to stay for his passport, and I was to give him
fifty pieces in broad gold. Next day I had the Ambassador's parole for
the other Captain, taken in Captain Allen's fight before Calais. I gave
the King an account of what I had done, and afterward asked the same
favor for another Captain, which his Majesty gave me.

28th April, 1665. I went to Tunbridge, to see a solemn exercise at the
free-school there.

Having taken orders with my marshal about my prisoners, and with the
doctor and chirurgeon to attend the wounded enemies, and of our own men,
I went to London again, and visited my charge, several with legs and
arms off; miserable objects, God knows.

16th May, 1665. To London, to consider of the poor orphans and widows
made by this bloody beginning, and whose husbands and relations perished
in the London frigate, of which there were fifty widows, and forty-five
of them with child.

26th May, 1665. To treat with the Holland Ambassador at Chelsea, for
release of divers prisoners of war in Holland on exchange here. After
dinner, being called into the Council-Chamber at Whitehall, I gave his
Majesty an account of what I had done, informing him of the vast charge
upon us, now amounting to no less than £1,000 weekly.

29th May, 1665. I went with my little boy to my district in Kent, to
make up accounts with my officers. Visited the Governor at Dover Castle,
where were some of my prisoners.

3d June, 1665. In my return went to Gravesend; the fleets being just now
engaged, gave special orders for my officers to be ready to receive the
wounded and prisoners.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th June, 1665. To London, to speak with his Majesty and the Duke of
Albemarle for horse and foot guards for the prisoners at war, committed
more particularly to my charge by a commission apart.

8th June, 1665. I went again to his Grace, thence to the Council, and
moved for another privy seal for £20,000, and that I might have the
disposal of the Savoy Hospital for the sick and wounded; all which was
granted. Hence to the Royal Society, to refresh among the philosophers.

Came news of his highness's victory, which indeed might have been a
complete one, and at once ended the war, had it been pursued, but the
cowardice of some, or treachery, or both, frustrated that. We had,
however, bonfires, bells, and rejoicing in the city. Next day, the 9th,
I had instant orders to repair to the Downs, so as I got to Rochester
this evening. Next day I lay at Deal, where I found all in readiness:
but, the fleet being hindered by contrary winds, I came away on the
12th, and went to Dover, and returned to Deal; and on the 13th, hearing
the fleet was at Solbay, I went homeward, and lay at Chatham, and on the
14th, I got home. On the 15th, came the eldest son of the present
Secretary of State to the French King, with much other company, to dine
with me. After dinner, I went with him to London, to speak to my Lord
General for more guards, and gave his Majesty an account of my journey
to the coasts under my inspection. I also waited on his Royal Highness,
now come triumphant from the fleet, gotten into repair. See the whole
history of this conflict in my "History of the Dutch War."

20th June, 1665. To London, and represented the state of the sick and
wounded to His Majesty in Council, for want of money, he ordered I
should apply to My Lord Treasurer and Chancellor of the Exchequer, upon
what funds to raise the money promised. We also presented to his Majesty
divers expedients for retrenchment of the charge.

This evening making my court to the Duke, I spake to Monsieur
Comminges, the French Ambassador, and his Highness granted me six
prisoners, Embdeners, who were desirous to go to the Barbadoes with a
merchant.

22d June, 1665. We waited on the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and got an
Order of Council for our money to be paid to the Treasurer of the Navy
for our Receivers.

23d June, 1665. I dined with Sir Robert Paston, since Earl of Yarmouth,
and saw the Duke of Verneuille, base brother to the Queen-Mother, a
handsome old man, a great hunter.

The Duke of York told us that, when we were in fight, his dog sought out
absolutely the very securest place in all the vessel.--In the afternoon,
I saw the pompous reception and audience of El Conde de Molino, the
Spanish Ambassador, in the Banqueting-house, both their Majesties
sitting together under the canopy of state.

30th June, 1665. To Chatham; and, 1st July, to the fleet with Lord
Sandwich, now Admiral, with whom I went in a pinnace to the Buoy of the
Nore, where the whole fleet rode at anchor; went on board the Prince, of
ninety brass ordnance, haply the best ship in the world, both for
building and sailing; she had 700 men. They made a great huzza, or
shout, at our approach, three times. Here we dined with many noblemen,
gentlemen, and volunteers, served in plate and excellent meat of all
sorts. After dinner, came his Majesty, the Duke, and Prince Rupert. Here
I saw the King knight Captain Custance for behaving so bravely in the
late fight. It was surprising to behold the good order, decency, and
plenty of all things in a vessel so full of men. The ship received a
hundred cannon shot in her body. Then I went on board the Charles, to
which after a gun was shot off, came all the flag officers to his
Majesty, who there held a General Council, which determined that his
Royal Highness should adventure himself no more this summer. I came away
late, having seen the most glorious fleet that ever spread sails. We
returned in his Majesty's yacht with my Lord Sandwich and Mr.
Vice-Chamberlain, landing at Chatham on Sunday morning.

5th July, 1665. I took order for 150 men, who had been recovered of
their wounds, to be carried on board the Clove Tree, Carolus Quintus,
and Zealand, ships that had been taken by us in the fight; and so
returned home.

7th July, 1665. To London, to Sir William Coventry; and so to Sion,
where his Majesty sat at Council during the contagion: when business was
over, I viewed that seat belonging to the Earl of Northumberland, built
out of an old nunnery, of stone, and fair enough, but more celebrated
for the garden than it deserves; yet there is excellent wall-fruit, and
a pretty fountain; nothing else extraordinary.

9th July, 1665. I went to Hampton-Court, where now the whole Court was,
to solicit for money; to carry intercepted letters; confer again with
Sir William Coventry, the Duke's secretary; and so home, having dined
with Mr. Secretary Morice.

16th July, 1665. There died of the plague in London this week 1,100; and
in the week following, above 2,000. Two houses were shut up in our
parish.

2d August, 1665. A solemn fast through England to deprecate God's
displeasure against the land by pestilence and war; our Doctor preaching
on 26 Levit. v. 41, 42, that the means to obtain remission of punishment
was not to repine at it; but humbly to submit to it.

3d August, 1665. Came his Grace the Duke of Albemarle, Lord General of
all his Majesty's forces, to visit me, and carried me to dine with him.

4th August, 1665. I went to Wotton with my Son and his tutor, Mr. Bohun,
Fellow of New College (recommended to me by Dr. Wilkins, and the
President of New College, Oxford), for fear of the pestilence, still
increasing in London and its environs. On my return, I called at
Durdans, where I found Dr. Wilkins, Sir William Petty, and Mr. Hooke,
contriving chariots, new rigging for ships, a wheel for one to run races
in, and other mechanical inventions; perhaps three such persons together
were not to be found elsewhere in Europe, for parts and ingenuity.

8th August, 1665. I waited on the Duke of Albemarle, who was resolved to
stay at the Cock-pit, in St. James's Park. Died this week in London,
4,000.

15th August, 1665. There perished this week 5,000.

28th August, 1665. The contagion still increasing, and growing now all
about us, I sent my wife and whole family (two or three necessary
servants excepted) to my brother's at Wotton, being resolved to stay at
my house myself, and to look after my charge, trusting in the providence
and goodness of God.

[Sidenote: CHATHAM]

5th September, 1665. To Chatham, to inspect my charge, with £900 in my
coach.

7th September, 1665. Came home, there perishing near 10,000 poor
creatures weekly; however, I went all along the city and suburbs from
Kent Street to St. James's, a dismal passage, and dangerous to see so
many coffins exposed in the streets, now thin of people; the shops shut
up, and all in mournful silence, not knowing whose turn might be next. I
went to the Duke of Albemarle for a pest-ship, to wait on our infected
men, who were not a few.

14th September, 1665. I went to Wotton; and on 16th September, to visit
old Secretary Nicholas, being now at his new purchase of West Horsley,
once mortgaged to me by Lord Viscount Montague: a pretty dry seat on the
Down. Returned to Wotton.

17th September, 1665. Receiving a letter from Lord Sandwich of a defeat
given to the Dutch, I was forced to travel all Sunday. I was exceedingly
perplexed to find that near 3,000 prisoners were sent to me to dispose
of, being more than I had places fit to receive and guard.

25th September, 1665. My Lord Admiral being come from the fleet to
Greenwich, I went thence with him to the Cock-pit, to consult with the
Duke of Albemarle. I was peremptory that, unless we had £10,000
immediately, the prisoners would starve, and it was proposed it should
be raised out of the East India prizes now taken by Lord Sandwich. They
being but two of the commission, and so not empowered to determine, sent
an express to his Majesty and Council, to know what they should do. In
the meantime, I had five vessels, with competent guards, to keep the
prisoners in for the present, to be placed as I should think best. After
dinner (which was at the General's) I went over to visit his Grace, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth.

28th September, 1665. To the General again, to acquaint him of the
deplorable state of our men for want of provisions; returned with
orders.

29th September, 1665. To Erith, to quicken the sale of the prizes lying
there, with order to the commissioner who lay on board till they should
be disposed of, £5,000 being proportioned for my quarter. Then I
delivered the Dutch Vice-Admiral, who was my prisoner, to Mr. Lo....
[2]of the Marshalsea, he giving me bond in £500 to produce him at my
call. I exceedingly pitied this brave unhappy person, who had lost with
these prizes £40,000 after twenty years' negotiation [trading] in the
East Indies. I dined in one of these vessels, of 1,200 tons, full of
riches.

    [Footnote 2: Mr. Lowman.]

1st October, 1665. This afternoon, while at evening prayers, tidings
were brought me of the birth of a daughter at Wotton, after six sons, in
the same chamber I had first taken breath in, and at the first day of
that month, as I was on the last, forty-five years before.

4th October, 1665. The monthly fast.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th October, 1665. To London, and went through the whole city, having
occasion to alight out of the coach in several places about business of
money, when I was environed with multitudes of poor, pestiferous
creatures begging alms; the shops universally shut up, a dreadful
prospect! I dined with my Lord General; was to receive £10,000, and had
guards to convey both myself and it, and so returned home, through God's
infinite mercy.

17th October, 1665. I went to Gravesend; next day to Chatham; thence to
Maidstone, in order to the march of 500 prisoners to Leeds Castle, which
I had hired of Lord Culpeper. I was earnestly desired by the learned Sir
Roger Twisden, and Deputy-Lieutenants, to spare Maidstone from
quartering any of my sick flock. Here, Sir Edward Brett sent me some
horse to bring up the rear. This country, from Rochester to Maidstone
and the Downs, is very agreeable for the prospect.

21st October, 1665. I came from Gravesend, where Sir J. Griffith, the
Governor of the Fort, entertained me very handsomely.

31st October, 1665. I was this day forty-five years of age wonderfully
preserved; for which I blessed God for his infinite goodness toward me.

23d November, 1665. Went home, the contagion having now decreased
considerably.

27th November, 1665. The Duke of Albemarle was going to Oxford, where
both Court and Parliament had been most part of the summer. There was no
small suspicion of my Lord Sandwich having permitted divers commanders,
who were at the taking of the East India prizes, to break bulk, and to
take to themselves jewels, silks, etc.: though I believe some whom I
could name filled their pockets, my Lord Sandwich himself had the least
share. However, he underwent the blame, and it created him enemies, and
prepossessed the Lord General, for he spoke to me of it with much zeal
and concern, and I believe laid load enough on Lord Sandwich at Oxford.

8th December, 1665. To my Lord of Albemarle (now returned from Oxford),
who was declared General at Sea, to the no small mortification of that
excellent person, the Earl of Sandwich, whom the Duke of Albemarle not
only suspected faulty about the prizes, but less valiant; himself
imagining how easy a thing it were to confound the Hollanders, as well
now as heretofore he fought against them upon a more disloyal interest.

25th December, 1665. Kept Christmas with my hospitable brother, at
Wotton.

30th December, 1665. To Woodcot, where I supped at my Lady Mordaunt's at
Ashsted, where was a room hung with _pintado_, full of figures great and
small, prettily representing sundry trades and occupations of the
Indians, with their habits; here supped also Dr. Duke, a learned and
facetious gentleman.

31st December, 1665. Now blessed be God for his extraordinary mercies
and preservation of me this year, when thousands, and ten thousands,
perished, and were swept away on each side of me, there dying in our
parish this year 406 of the pestilence!

3d January, 1665-66. I supped in Nonesuch House,[3] whither the office
of the Exchequer was transferred during the plague, at my good friend
Mr. Packer's, and took an exact view of the plaster statues and
bass-relievos inserted between the timbers and puncheons of the outside
walls of the Court; which must needs have been the work of some
celebrated Italian. I much admired how they had lasted so well and
entire since the time of Henry VIII., exposed as they are to the air;
and pity it is they are not taken out and preserved in some dry place; a
gallery would become them. There are some mezzo-relievos as big as the
life; the story is of the Heathen Gods, emblems, compartments, etc. The
palace consists of two courts, of which the first is of stone, castle
like, by the Lord Lumleys (of whom it was purchased), the other of
timber, a Gothic fabric, but these walls incomparably beautiful. I
observed that the appearing timber-puncheons, entrelices, etc., were all
so covered with scales of slate, that it seemed carved in the wood and
painted, the slate fastened on the timber in pretty figures, that has,
like a coat of armor, preserved it from rotting. There stand in the
garden two handsome stone pyramids, and the avenue planted with rows of
fair elms, but the rest of these goodly trees, both of this and of
Worcester Park adjoining, were felled by those destructive and
avaricious rebels in the late war, which defaced one of the stateliest
seats his Majesty had.

    [Footnote 3: Of this famous summer residence of Queen Elizabeth not
    a vestige remains.]

12th January, 1666. After much, and indeed extraordinary mirth and
cheer, all my brothers, our wives, and children, being together, and
after much sorrow and trouble during this contagion, which separated our
families as well as others, I returned to my house, but my wife went
back to Wotton. I, not as yet willing to adventure her, the contagion,
though exceedingly abated, not as yet wholly extinguished among us.

29th January, 1666. I went to wait on his Majesty, now returned from
Oxford to Hampton-Court, where the Duke of Albemarle presented me to
him; he ran toward me, and in a most gracious manner gave me his hand to
kiss, with many thanks for my care and faithfulness in his service in a
time of such great danger, when everybody fled their employments; he
told me he was much obliged to me, and said he was several times
concerned for me, and the peril I underwent, and did receive my service
most acceptably (though in truth I did but do my duty, and O that I had
performed it as I ought!). After this, his Majesty was pleased to talk
with me alone, near an hour, of several particulars of my employment,
and ordered me to attend him again on the Thursday following at
Whitehall. Then the Duke came toward me, and embraced me with much
kindness, telling me if he had thought my danger would have been so
great, he would not have suffered his Majesty to employ me in that
station. Then came to salute me my Lord of St. Albans, Lord Arlington,
Sir William Coventry, and several great persons; after which, I got
home, not being very well in health.

The Court was now in deep mourning for the French Queen-Mother.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d February, 1666. To London; his Majesty now come to Whitehall, where I
heard and saw my Lord Mayor (and brethren) make his speech of welcome,
and the two Sheriffs were knighted.

6th February, 1666. My wife and family returned to me from the country,
where they had been since August, by reason of the contagion, now almost
universally ceasing. Blessed be God for his infinite mercy in preserving
us! I, having gone through so much danger, and lost so many of my poor
officers, escaping still myself that I might live to recount and magnify
his goodness to me.

8th February, 1666. I had another gracious reception by his Majesty, who
called me into his bed-chamber, to lay before and describe to him my
project of an Infirmary, which I read to him, who with great
approbation, recommended it to his Royal Highness.

20th February, 1666. To the Commissioners of the Navy who, having seen
the project of the Infirmary, encouraged the work, and were very earnest
it should be set about immediately; but I saw no money, though a very
moderate expense would have saved thousands to his Majesty, and been
much more commodious for the cure and quartering of our sick and
wounded, than the dispersing them into private houses, where many more
chirurgeons and attendants were necessary, and the people tempted to
debauchery.

21st February, 1666. Went to my Lord Treasurer for an assignment of
£40,000 upon the last two quarters for support of the next year's
charge. Next day, to Duke of Albemarle and Secretary of State, to desire
them to propose it to the Council.

1st March, 1666. To London, and presented his Majesty my book intitled,
"The Pernicious Consequences of the new Heresy of the Jesuits against
Kings and States."

7th March, 1666. Dr. Sancroft, since Archbishop of Canterbury, preached
before the King about the identity and immutability of God, on Psalm
cii. 27.

13th March, 1666. To Chatham, to view a place designed for an
Infirmary.

15th March, 1666. My charge now amounted to near £7,000 [weekly].

22d March, 1666. The Royal Society reassembled, after the dispersion
from the contagion.

24th March, 1666. Sent £2,000 to Chatham.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st April, 1666. To London, to consult about ordering the natural
rarities belonging to the repository of the Royal Society; referred to a
Committee.

10th April, 1666. Visited Sir William D'Oyly, surprised with a fit of
apoplexy, and in extreme danger.

11th April, 1666. Dr. Bathurst preached before the King, from "I say
unto you all, watch"--a seasonable and most excellent discourse. When
his Majesty came from chapel, he called to me in the lobby, and told me
he must now have me sworn for a Justice of Peace (having long since made
me of the Commission); which I declined as inconsistent with the other
service I was engaged in, and humbly desired to be excused. After
dinner, waiting on him, I gave him the first notice of the Spaniards
referring the umpirage of the peace between them and Portugal to the
French King, which came to me in a letter from France before the
Secretaries of State had any news of it. After this, his Majesty again
asked me if I had found out any able person about our parts that might
supply my place of Justice of Peace (the office in the world I had most
industriously avoided, in regard of the perpetual trouble thereof in
these numerous parishes); on which I nominated one, whom the King
commanded me to give immediate notice of to my Lord Chancellor, and I
should be excused; for which I rendered his Majesty many thanks. From
thence, I went to the Royal Society, where I was chosen by twenty-seven
voices to be one of their Council for the ensuing year; but, upon my
earnest suit in respect of my other affairs, I got to be excused--and so
home.

15th April, 1666. Our parish was now more infected with the plague than
ever, and so was all the country about, though almost quite ceased at
London.

24th April, 1666. To London about our Mint-Commission, and sat in the
inner Court of Wards.

8th May, 1666. To Queensborough, where finding the Richmond frigate, I
sailed to the buoy of the Nore to my Lord-General and Prince Rupert,
where was the Rendezvous of the most glorious fleet in the world, now
preparing to meet the Hollander. Went to visit my cousin, Hales, at a
sweetly-watered place at Chilston, near Bockton. The next morning, to
Leeds Castle, once a famous hold, now hired by me of my Lord Culpeper
for a prison. Here I flowed the dry moat, made a new drawbridge, brought
spring water into the court of the Castle to an old fountain, and took
order for the repairs.

22d May, 1666. Waited on my Lord Chancellor at his new palace; and Lord
Berkeley's built next to it.

24th May, 1666. Dined with Lord Cornbury, now made Lord Chamberlain to
the Queen; who kept a very honorable table.

1st June, 1666. Being in my garden at 6 o'clock in the evening, and
hearing the great guns go thick off, I took horse and rode that night to
Rochester; thence next day toward the Downs and seacoast, but meeting
the Lieutenant of the Hampshire frigate, who told me what passed, or
rather what had not passed, I returned to London, there being no noise,
or appearance at Deal, or on that coast of any engagement. Recounting
this to his Majesty, whom I found at St. James's Park, impatiently
expecting, and knowing that Prince Rupert was loose about three at St.
Helen's Point at N. of the Isle of Wight, it greatly rejoiced him; but
he was astonished when I assured him they heard nothing of the guns in
the Downs, nor did the Lieutenant who landed there by five that morning.

3d June, 1666. Whitsunday. After sermon came news that the Duke of
Albemarle was still in fight, and had been all Saturday, and that
Captain Harman's ship (the Henry) was like to be burnt. Then a letter
from Mr. Bertie that Prince Rupert was come up with his squadron
(according to my former advice of his being loose and in the way), and
put new courage into our fleet, now in a manner yielding ground; so that
now we were chasing the chasers; that the Duke of Albemarle was slightly
wounded, and the rest still in great danger. So, having been much
wearied with my journey, I slipped home, the guns still roaring very
fiercely.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th June, 1666. I went this morning to London, where came several
particulars of the fight.

6th June, 1666. Came Sir Daniel Harvey from the General and related the
dreadful encounter, on which his Majesty commanded me to dispatch an
extraordinary physician and more chirurgeons. It was on the solemn
Fast-day when the news came; his Majesty being in the chapel made a
sudden stop to hear the relation, which being with much advantage on our
side, his Majesty commanded that public thanks should immediately be
given as for a victory. The Dean of the chapel going down to give notice
of it to the other Dean officiating; and notice was likewise sent to St.
Paul's and Westminster Abbey. But this was no sooner over, than news
came that our loss was very great both in ships and men; that the Prince
frigate was burnt, and as noble a vessel of ninety brass guns lost; and
the taking of Sir George Ayscue, and exceeding shattering of both
fleets; so as both being obstinate, both parted rather for want of
ammunition and tackle than courage; our General retreating like a lion;
which exceedingly abated of our former joy. There were, however, orders
given for bonfires and bells; but, God knows, it was rather a
deliverance than a triumph. So much it pleased God to humble our late
overconfidence that nothing could withstand the Duke of Albemarle, who,
in good truth, made too forward a reckoning of his success now, because
he had once beaten the Dutch in another quarrel; and being ambitious to
outdo the Earl of Sandwich, whom he had prejudicated as deficient in
courage.

7th June, 1666. I sent more chirurgeons, linen, medicaments, etc., to
the several ports in my district.

8th June, 1666. Dined with me Sir Alexander Fraser, prime physician to
his Majesty; afterward, went on board his Majesty's pleasure-boat, when
I saw the London frigate launched, a most stately ship, built by the
City to supply that which was burnt by accident some time since; the
King, Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, being there with great banquet.

11th June, 1666. Trinity Monday, after a sermon, applied to the
remeeting of the Corporation of the Trinity-House, after the late raging
and wasting pestilence: I dined with them in their new room in Deptford,
the first time since it was rebuilt.

15th June, 1666. I went to Chatham.--16th. In the Jemmy yacht (an
incomparable sailer) to sea, arrived by noon at the fleet at the Buoy at
the Nore, dined with Prince Rupert and the General.

17th June, 1666. Came his Majesty, the Duke, and many Noblemen. After
Council, we went to prayers. My business being dispatched, I returned to
Chatham, having lain but one night in the Royal Charles; we had a
tempestuous sea. I went on shore at Sheerness, where they were building
an arsenal for the fleet, and designing a royal fort with a receptacle
for great ships to ride at anchor; but here I beheld the sad spectacle,
more than half that gallant bulwark of the kingdom miserably shattered,
hardly a vessel entire, but appearing rather so many wrecks and hulls,
so cruelly had the Dutch mangled us. The loss of the Prince, that
gallant vessel, had been a loss to be universally deplored, none knowing
for what reason we first engaged in this ungrateful war; we lost besides
nine or ten more, and near 600 men slain and 1,100 wounded, 2,000
prisoners; to balance which, perhaps we might destroy eighteen or twenty
of the enemy's ships, and 700 or 800 poor men.

18th June, 1666. Weary of this sad sight, I returned home.

2d July, 1666. Came Sir John Duncomb and Mr. Thomas Chicheley, both
Privy Councillors and Commissioners of His Majesty's Ordnance, to visit
me, and let me know that his Majesty had in Council, nominated me to be
one of the Commissioners for regulating the farming and making of
saltpetre through the whole kingdom, and that we were to sit in the
Tower the next day. When they were gone, came to see me Sir John Cotton,
heir to the famous antiquary, Sir Robert Cotton: a pretended great
Grecian, but had by no means the parts, or genius of his grandfather.

3d July, 1666. I went to sit with the Commissioners at the Tower, where
our commission being read, we made some progress in business, our
Secretary being Sir George Wharton, that famous mathematician who wrote
the yearly Almanac during his Majesty's troubles. Thence, to Painters'
Hall, to our other commission, and dined at my Lord Mayor's.

4th July, 1666. The solemn Fast-day. Dr. Meggot preached an excellent
discourse before the King on the terrors of God's judgments. After
sermon, I waited on my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of
Winchester, where the Dean of Westminster spoke to me about putting into
my hands the disposal of fifty pounds, which the charitable people of
Oxford had sent to be distributed among the sick and wounded seamen
since the battle. Hence, I went to the Lord Chancellor's to joy him of
his Royal Highness's second son, now born at St. James's; and to desire
the use of the Star-chamber for our Commissioners to meet in, Painters'
Hall not being so convenient.

12th July, 1666. We sat the first time in the Star-chamber. There was
now added to our commission Sir George Downing (one that had been a
great ... against his Majesty, but now insinuated into his favor; and,
from a pedagogue and fanatic preacher, not worth a groat, had become
excessively rich), to inspect the hospitals and treat about prisons.

14th July, 1666. Sat at the Tower with Sir J. Duncomb and Lord Berkeley,
to sign deputations for undertakers to furnish their proportions of
saltpetre.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th July, 1666. To London, to prepare for the next engagement of the
fleets, now gotten to sea again.

22d July, 1666. Our parish still infected with the contagion.

25th July, 1666. The fleets engaged. I dined at Lord Berkeley's, at St.
James's, where dined my Lady Harrietta Hyde, Lord Arlington, and Sir
John Duncomb.

29th July, 1666. The pestilence now fresh increasing in our parish, I
forbore going to church. In the afternoon came tidings of our victory
over the Dutch, sinking some, and driving others aground, and into their
ports.

1st August, 1666. I went to Dr. Keffler, who married the daughter of the
famous chemist, Drebbell,[4] inventor of the bodied scarlet. I went to
see his iron ovens, made portable (formerly) for the Prince of Orange's
army: supped at the Rhenish Wine-House with divers Scots gentlemen.

    [Footnote 4: Cornelius Van Drebbell, born at Alkmaar, in Holland, in
    1572; but in the reign of Charles I. settled in London, where he
    died in 1634. He was famous for other discoveries in science besides
    that mentioned by Evelyn--the most important of which was the
    thermometer. He also made improvements in microscopes and
    telescopes; and though, like many of his scientific contemporaries,
    something of an empiric, possessed a considerable knowledge of
    chemistry and of different branches of natural philosophy.]

6th August, 1666. Dined with Mr. Povey, and then went with him to see a
country house he had bought near Brentford; returning by Kensington;
which house stands to a very graceful avenue of trees, but it is an
ordinary building, especially one part.

8th August, 1666. Dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with several friends and,
on the 10th, with Mr. Odart, Secretary of the Latin tongue.

17th August, 1666. Dined with the Lord Chancellor, whom I entreated to
visit the Hospital of the Savoy, and reduce it (after the great abuse
that had been continued) to its original institution for the benefit of
the poor, which he promised to do.

25th August, 1666. Waited on Sir William D'Oyly, now recovered, as it
were, miraculously. In the afternoon, visited the Savoy Hospital, where
I stayed to see the miserably dismembered and wounded men dressed, and
gave some necessary orders. Then to my Lord Chancellor, who had, with
the Bishop of London and others in the commission, chosen me one of the
three surveyors of the repairs of Paul's, and to consider of a model for
the new building, or, if it might be, repairing of the steeple, which
was most decayed.

26th August, 1666. The contagion still continuing, we had the Church
service at home.

27th August, 1666. I went to St. Paul's church, where, with Dr. Wren,
Mr. Pratt, Mr. May, Mr. Thomas Chicheley, Mr. Slingsby, the Bishop of
London, the Dean of St. Paul's, and several expert workmen, we went
about to survey the general decays of that ancient and venerable church,
and to set down in writing the particulars of what was fit to be done,
with the charge thereof, giving our opinion from article to article.
Finding the main building to recede outward it was the opinion of
Chicheley and Mr. Pratt that it had been so built _ab origine_ for an
effect in perspective, in regard of the height; but I was, with Dr.
Wren, quite of another judgment, and so we entered it; we plumbed the
uprights in several places. When we came to the steeple, it was
deliberated whether it were not well enough to repair it only on its old
foundation, with reservation to the four pillars; this Mr. Chicheley and
Mr. Pratt were also for, but we totally rejected it, and persisted that
it required a new foundation, not only in regard of the necessity, but
for that the shape of what stood was very mean, and we had a mind to
build it with a noble cupola, a form of church-building not as yet known
in England, but of wonderful grace. For this purpose, we offered to
bring in a plan and estimate, which after much contest, was at last
assented to, and that we should nominate a committee of able workmen to
examine the present foundation. This concluded, we drew all up in
writing, and so went with my Lord Bishop to the Dean's.

28th August, 1666. Sat at the Star-chamber. Next day, to the Royal
Society, where one Mercator, an excellent mathematician, produced his
rare clock and new motion to perform the equations, and Mr. Rooke, his
new pendulum.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d September, 1666. This fatal night, about ten, began the deplorable
fire, near Fish street, in London.

3d September, 1666. I had public prayers at home. The fire continuing,
after dinner, I took coach with my wife and son, and went to the
Bankside in Southwark, where we beheld that dismal spectacle, the whole
city in dreadful flames near the waterside; all the houses from the
Bridge, all Thames street, and upward toward Cheapside, down to the
Three Cranes, were now consumed; and so returned, exceedingly astonished
what would become of the rest.

The fire having continued all this night (if I may call that night
which was light as day for ten miles round about, after a dreadful
manner), when conspiring with a fierce eastern wind in a very dry
season, I went on foot to the same place; and saw the whole south part
of the city burning from Cheapside to the Thames, and all along Cornhill
(for it likewise kindled back against the wind as well as forward),
Tower street, Fenchurch street, Gracious street, and so along to
Baynard's Castle, and was now taking hold of St. Paul's church, to which
the scaffolds contributed exceedingly. The conflagration was so
universal, and the people so astonished, that, from the beginning, I
know not by what despondency, or fate, they hardly stirred to quench it;
so that there was nothing heard, or seen, but crying out and
lamentation, running about like distracted creatures, without at all
attempting to save even their goods; such a strange consternation there
was upon them, so as it burned both in breadth and length, the churches,
public halls, Exchange, hospitals, monuments, and ornaments; leaping
after a prodigious manner, from house to house, and street to street, at
great distances one from the other. For the heat, with a long set of
fair and warm weather, had even ignited the air, and prepared the
materials to conceive the fire, which devoured, after an incredible
manner, houses, furniture, and every thing. Here, we saw the Thames
covered with goods floating, all the barges and boats laden with what
some had time and courage to save, as, on the other side, the carts,
etc., carrying out to the fields, which for many miles were strewn with
movables of all sorts, and tents erecting to shelter both people and
what goods they could get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous
spectacle! such as haply the world had not seen since the foundation of
it, nor can be outdone till the universal conflagration thereof. All the
sky was of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning oven, and the light
seen above forty miles round about for many nights. God grant mine eyes
may never behold the like, who now saw above 10,000 houses all in one
flame! The noise and cracking and thunder of the impetuous flames, the
shrieking of women and children, the hurry of people, the fall of
towers, houses, and churches, was like a hideous storm; and the air all
about so hot and inflamed, that at the last one was not able to approach
it, so that they were forced to stand still, and let the flames burn on,
which they did, for near two miles in length and one in breadth. The
clouds also of smoke were dismal, and reached, upon computation, near
fifty miles in length. Thus, I left it this afternoon burning, a
resemblance of Sodom, or the last day. It forcibly called to my mind
that passage--"_non enim hic habemus stabilem civitatem_"; the ruins
resembling the picture of Troy. London was, but is no more! Thus, I
returned.

4th September, 1666. The burning still rages, and it is now gotten as
far as the Inner Temple. All Fleet street, the Old Bailey, Ludgate hill,
Warwick lane, Newgate, Paul's chain, Watling street, now flaming, and
most of it reduced to ashes; the stones of Paul's flew like grenados,
the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very
pavements glowing with fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able
to tread on them, and the demolition had stopped all the passages, so
that no help could be applied. The eastern wind still more impetuously
driving the flames forward. Nothing but the Almighty power of God was
able to stop them; for vain was the help of man.

5th September, 1666. It crossed toward Whitehall; but oh! the confusion
there was then at that Court! It pleased his Majesty to command me,
among the rest, to look after the quenching of Fetter-lane end, to
preserve (if possible) that part of Holborn, while the rest of the
gentlemen took their several posts, some at one part, and some at
another (for now they began to bestir themselves, and not till now, who
hitherto had stood as men intoxicated, with their hands across), and
began to consider that nothing was likely to put a stop but the blowing
up of so many houses as might make a wider gap than any had yet been
made by the ordinary method of pulling them down with engines. This some
stout seamen proposed early enough to have saved near the whole city,
but this some tenacious and avaricious men, aldermen, etc., would not
permit, because their houses must have been of the first. It was,
therefore, now commended to be practiced; and my concern being
particularly for the Hospital of St. Bartholomew, near Smithfield, where
I had many wounded and sick men, made me the more diligent to promote
it; nor was my care for the Savoy less. It now pleased God, by abating
the wind, and by the industry of the people, when almost all was lost
infusing a new spirit into them, that the fury of it began sensibly to
abate about noon, so as it came no farther than the Temple westward, nor
than the entrance of Smithfield, north: but continued all this day and
night so impetuous toward Cripplegate and the Tower, as made us all
despair. It also broke out again in the temple; but the courage of the
multitude persisting, and many houses being blown up, such gaps and
desolations were soon made, as, with the former three days' consumption,
the back fire did not so vehemently urge upon the rest as formerly.
There was yet no standing near the burning and glowing ruins by near a
furlong's space.

The coal and wood wharfs, and magazines of oil, rosin, etc., did
infinite mischief, so as the invective which a little before I had
dedicated to his Majesty and published,[5] giving warning what probably
might be the issue of suffering those shops to be in the city was looked
upon as a prophecy.

    [Footnote 5: The _Fumifugium_.]

The poor inhabitants were dispersed about St. George's Fields, and
Moorfields, as far as Highgate, and several miles in circle, some under
tents, some under miserable huts and hovels, many without a rag, or any
necessary utensils, bed or board, who from delicateness, riches, and
easy accommodations in stately and well-furnished houses, were now
reduced to extreme misery and poverty.

In this calamitous condition, I returned with a sad heart to my house,
blessing and adoring the distinguishing mercy of God to me and mine,
who, in the midst of all this ruin, was like Lot, in my little Zoar,
safe and sound.

6th September, 1666. Thursday. I represented to his Majesty the case of
the French prisoners at war in my custody, and besought him that there
might be still the same care of watching at all places contiguous to
unseized houses. It is not indeed imaginable how extraordinary the
vigilance and activity of the King and the Duke was, even laboring in
person, and being present to command, order, reward, or encourage
workmen; by which he showed his affection to his people, and gained
theirs. Having, then, disposed of some under cure at the Savoy, I
returned to Whitehall, where I dined at Mr. Offley's, the groom-porter,
who was my relation.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1666. I went this morning on foot from Whitehall as far
as London Bridge, through the late Fleet street, Ludgate hill by St.
Paul's, Cheapside, Exchange, Bishops-gate, Aldersgate, and out to
Moorfields, thence through Cornhill, etc., with extraordinary
difficulty, clambering over heaps of yet smoking rubbish, and frequently
mistaking where I was; the ground under my feet so hot, that it even
burnt the soles of my shoes. In the meantime, his Majesty got to the
Tower by water, to demolish the houses about the graff, which, being
built entirely about it, had they taken fire and attacked the White
Tower, where the magazine of powder lay, would undoubtedly not only have
beaten down and destroyed all the bridge, but sunk and torn the vessels
in the river, and rendered the demolition beyond all expression for
several miles about the country.

At my return, I was infinitely concerned to find that goodly Church,
St. Paul's--now a sad ruin, and that beautiful portico (for structure
comparable to any in Europe, as not long before repaired by the late
King) now rent in pieces, flakes of large stones split asunder, and
nothing remaining entire but the inscription in the architrave showing
by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defaced! It was
astonishing to see what immense stones the heat had in a manner
calcined, so that all the ornaments, columns, friezes, capitals, and
projectures of massy Portland stone, flew off, even to the very roof,
where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six acres by
measure) was totally melted. The ruins of the vaulted roof falling,
broke into St. Faith's, which being filled with the magazines of books
belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were
all consumed, burning for a week following. It is also observable that
the lead over the altar at the east end was untouched, and among the
divers monuments the body of one bishop remained entire. Thus lay in
ashes that most venerable church, one of the most ancient pieces of
early piety in the Christian world, besides near one hundred more. The
lead, ironwork, bells, plate, etc., melted, the exquisitely wrought
Mercers' Chapel, the sumptuous Exchange, the august fabric of Christ
Church, all the rest of the Companies' Halls, splendid buildings,
arches, entries, all in dust; the fountains dried up and ruined, while
the very waters remained boiling; the voragos of subterranean cellars,
wells, and dungeons, formerly warehouses, still burning in stench and
dark clouds of smoke; so that in five or six miles traversing about I
did not see one load of timber unconsumed, nor many stones but what were
calcined white as snow.

The people, who now walked about the ruins, appeared like men in some
dismal desert, or rather, in some great city laid waste by a cruel
enemy; to which was added the stench that came from some poor creatures'
bodies, beds, and other combustible goods. Sir Thomas Gresham's statue,
though fallen from its niche in the Royal Exchange, remained entire,
when all those of the Kings since the Conquest were broken to pieces.
Also the standard in Cornhill, and Queen Elizabeth's effigies, with some
arms on Ludgate, continued with but little detriment, while the vast
iron chains of the city streets, hinges, bars, and gates of prisons,
were many of them melted and reduced to cinders by the vehement heat.
Nor was I yet able to pass through any of the narrow streets, but kept
the widest; the ground and air, smoke and fiery vapor, continued so
intense, that my hair was almost singed, and my feet insufferably
surbated. The by-lanes and narrow streets were quite filled up with
rubbish; nor could one have possibly known where he was, but by the
ruins of some Church, or Hall, that had some remarkable tower, or
pinnacle remaining.

I then went towards Islington and Highgate, where one might have seen
200,000 people of all ranks and degrees dispersed, and lying along by
their heaps of what they could save from the fire, deploring their loss;
and, though ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking
one penny for relief, which to me appeared a stranger sight than any I
had yet beheld. His Majesty and Council indeed took all imaginable care
for their relief, by proclamation for the country to come in, and
refresh them with provisions.

In the midst of all this calamity and confusion, there was, I know not
how, an alarm begun that the French and Dutch, with whom we were now in
hostility, were not only landed, but even entering the city. There was,
in truth, some days before, great suspicion of those two nations
joining; and now that they had been the occasion of firing the town.
This report did so terrify, that on a sudden there was such an uproar
and tumult that they ran from their goods, and, taking what weapons they
could come at, they could not be stopped from falling on some of those
nations whom they casually met, without sense or reason. The clamor and
peril grew so excessive, that it made the whole Court amazed, and they
did with infinite pains and great difficulty, reduce and appease the
people, sending troops of soldiers and guards, to cause them to retire
into the fields again, where they were watched all this night. I left
them pretty quiet, and came home sufficiently weary and broken. Their
spirits thus a little calmed, and the affright abated, they now began to
repair into the suburbs about the city, where such as had friends, or
opportunity, got shelter for the present to which his Majesty's
proclamation also invited them.

Still, the plague continuing in our parish, I could not, without danger,
adventure to our church.

10th September, 1666. I went again to the ruins; for it was now no
longer a city.

13th September, 1666. I presented his Majesty with a survey of the
ruins, and a plot for a new city, with a discourse on it; whereupon,
after dinner, his Majesty sent for me into the Queen's bed-chamber, her
Majesty and the Duke only being present. They examined each particular,
and discoursed on them for near an hour, seeming to be extremely pleased
with what I had so early thought on. The Queen was now in her cavalier
riding-habit, hat and feather, and horseman's coat, going to take the
air.

16th September, 1666. I went to Greenwich Church, where Mr. Plume
preached very well from this text: "Seeing, then, all these things shall
be dissolved," etc.: taking occasion from the late unparalleled
conflagration to remind us how we ought to walk more holy in all manner
of conversation.

27th September, 1666. Dined at Sir William D'Oyly's, with that worthy
gentleman, Sir John Holland, of Suffolk.

10th October, 1666. This day was ordered a general Fast through the
Nation, to humble us on the late dreadful conflagration, added to the
plague and war, the most dismal judgments that could be inflicted; but
which indeed we highly deserved for our prodigious ingratitude, burning
lusts, dissolute court, profane and abominable lives, under such
dispensations of God's continued favor in restoring Church, Prince, and
People from our late intestine calamities, of which we were altogether
unmindful, even to astonishment. This made me resolve to go to our
parish assembly, where our Doctor preached on Luke xix. 41: piously
applying it to the occasion. After which, was a collection for the
distressed losers in the late fire.

18th October, 1666. To Court. It being the first time his Majesty put
himself solemnly into the Eastern fashion of vest, changing doublet,
stiff collar, bands and cloak, into a comely dress, after the Persian
mode, with girdles or straps, and shoestrings and garters into buckles,
of which some were set with precious stones[6] resolving never to alter
it, and to leave the French mode, which had hitherto obtained to our
great expense and reproach. Upon which, divers courtiers and gentlemen
gave his Majesty gold by way of wager that he would not persist in this
resolution. I had sometime before presented an invective against that
unconstancy, and our so much affecting the French fashion, to his
Majesty; in which I took occasion to describe the comeliness and
usefulness of the Persian clothing, in the very same manner his Majesty
now clad himself. This pamphlet I entitled "_Tyrannus, or the Mode_,"
and gave it to the King to read. I do not impute to this discourse the
change which soon happened, but it was an identity that I could not but
take notice of.

    [Footnote 6: This costume was shortly after abandoned, and laid
    aside; nor does any existing portrait exhibit the King so
    accoutered.]

This night was acted my Lord Broghill's tragedy, called "_Mustapha_,"
before their Majesties at Court, at which I was present; very seldom
going to the public theatres for many reasons now, as they were abused
to an atheistical liberty; foul and indecent women now (and never till
now) permitted to appear and act, who inflaming several young noblemen
and gallants, became their misses, and to some, their wives. Witness the
Earl of Oxford, Sir R. Howard, Prince Rupert, the Earl of Dorset, and
another greater person than any of them, who fell into their snares, to
the reproach of their noble families, and ruin of both body and soul.[7]
I was invited by my Lord Chamberlain to see this tragedy, exceedingly
well written, though in my mind I did not approve of any such pastime in
a time of such judgments and calamities.

    [Footnote 7: Among the principal offenders here aimed at were Mrs.
    Margaret Hughes, Mrs. Eleanor Gwynne, Mrs. Davenport, Mrs. Uphill,
    Mrs. Davis, and Mrs. Knight. Mrs. Davenport (Roxolana) was "my Lord
    Oxford's Miss;" Mrs. Uphill was the actress alluded to in connection
    with Sir R. Howard; Mrs. Hughes ensnared Prince Rupert; and the last
    of the "misses" referred to by Evelyn was Nell Gwynne.]

21st October, 1666. This season, after so long and extraordinary a
drought in August and September, as if preparatory for the dreadful
fire, was so very wet and rainy as many feared an ensuing famine.

28th October, 1666. The pestilence, through God's mercy, began now to
abate considerably in our town.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1666. To London to our office, and now had I on the vest
and surcoat, or tunic, as it was called, after his Majesty had brought
the whole court to it. It was a comely and manly habit, too good to
hold, it being impossible for us in good earnest to leave the Monsieurs'
vanities long.

31st October, 1666. I heard the signal cause of my Lord Cleveland
pleaded before the House of Lords; and was this day forty-six years of
age, wonderfully protected by the mercies of God, for which I render him
immortal thanks.

14th November, 1666. I went my winter circle through my district,
Rochester and other places, where I had men quartered, and in custody.

15th November, 1666. To Leeds Castle.

16th November, 1666. I mustered the prisoners, being about 600 Dutch and
French, ordered their proportion of bread to be augmented and provided
clothes and fuel. Monsieur Colbert, Ambassador at the Court of England,
this day sent money from his master, the French King, to every prisoner
of that nation under my guard.

17th November, 1666. I returned to Chatham, my chariot overturning on
the steep of Bexley Hill, wounded me in two places on the head; my son,
Jack, being with me, was like to have been worse cut by the glass; but I
thank God we both escaped without much hurt, though not without
exceeding danger.

18th November, 1666. At Rochester.

19th November, 1666. Returned home.

23d November, 1666. At London, I heard an extraordinary case before a
Committee of the whole House of Commons, in the Commons' House of
Parliament, between one Captain Taylor and my Lord Viscount Mordaunt,
where, after the lawyers had pleaded and the witnesses been examined,
such foul and dishonorable things were produced against his Lordship, of
tyranny during his government of Windsor Castle, of which he was
Constable, incontinence, and suborning witnesses (of which last, one Sir
Richard Breames was most concerned), that I was exceedingly interested
for his Lordship, who was my special friend, and husband of the most
virtuous lady in the world. We sat till near ten at night, and yet but
half the counsel had done on behalf of the plaintiff. The question then
was put for bringing in of lights to sit longer. This lasted so long
before it was determined, and raised such a confused noise among the
members, that a stranger would have been astonished at it. I admire that
there is not a rationale to regulate such trifling accidents, which
consume much time, and is a reproach to the gravity of so great an
assembly of sober men.

27th November, 1666. Sir Hugh Pollard, Comptroller of the Household,
died at Whitehall, and his Majesty conferred the white staff on my
brother Commissioner for sick and wounded, Sir Thomas Clifford, a bold
young gentleman, of a small fortune in Devon, but advanced by Lord
Arlington, Secretary of State, to the great astonishment of all the
Court. This gentleman was somewhat related to me by the marriage of his
mother to my nearest kinsman, Gregory Coale, and was ever my noble
friend, a valiant and daring person, but by no means fit for a supple
and flattering courtier.

28th November, 1666. Went to see Clarendon House, now almost finished, a
goodly pile to see, but had many defects as to the architecture, yet
placed most gracefully. After this, I waited on the Lord Chancellor, who
was now at Berkshire House, since the burning of London.

2d December, 1666. Dined with me Monsieur Kiviet, a Dutch
gentleman-pensioner of Rotterdam, who came over for protection, being of
the Prince of Orange's party, now not welcome in Holland. The King
knighted him for some merit in the Prince's behalf. He should, if
caught, have been beheaded with Monsieur Buat, and was brother-in-law to
Van Tromp, the sea-general. With him came Mr. Gabriel Sylvius, and Mr.
Williamson, secretary to Lord Arlington; M. Kiviet came to examine
whether the soil about the river of Thames would be proper to make
clinker bricks, and to treat with me about some accommodation in order
to it.

9th January, 1666-67. To the Royal Society, which since the sad
conflagration were invited by Mr. Howard to sit at Arundel-House in the
Strand, who at my instigation likewise bestowed on the Society that
noble library which his grandfather especially, and his ancestors had
collected. This gentleman had so little inclination to books, that it
was the preservation of them from embezzlement.

24th January, 1667. Visited my Lord Clarendon, and presented my son,
John, to him, now preparing to go to Oxford, of which his Lordship was
Chancellor. This evening I heard rare Italian voices, two eunuchs and
one woman, in his Majesty's green chamber, next his cabinet.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th January, 1667. To London, in order to my son's Oxford journey, who,
being very early entered both in Latin and Greek, and prompt to learn
beyond most of his age, I was persuaded to trust him under the tutorage
of Mr. Bohun, Fellow of New College, who had been his preceptor in my
house some years before; but, at Oxford, under the inspection of Dr.
Bathurst, President of Trinity College, where I placed him, not as yet
thirteen years old. He was newly out of long coats.[8]

    [Footnote 8: In illustration of the garb which succeeded the "long
    coats" out of which lads of twelve or thirteen were thus suffered to
    emerge, it may be mentioned that there hung, some years ago, and
    perhaps may hang still, upon the walls of the Swan Inn at
    Leatherhead in Surrey, a picture of four children, dates of birth
    between 1640 and 1650, of whom a lad of about the age of young
    Evelyn is represented in a coat reaching to his ankles.]

15th February, 1667. My little book, in answer to Sir George Mackenzie
on Solitude, was now published, entitled "Public Employment, and an
active Life with its Appanages, preferred to Solitude."[9]

    [Footnote 9: Reprinted in "Miscellaneous Writings," pp. 501-509. In
    a letter to Cowley, 12th March, 1666, Evelyn apologises for having
    written against that life which he had joined with Mr. Cowley in so
    much admiring, assuring him he neither was nor could be serious in
    avowing such a preference.]

18th February, 1667. I was present at a magnificent ball, or masque, in
the theatre at the Court, where their Majesties and all the great lords
and ladies danced, infinitely gallant, the men in their richly
embroidered, most becoming vests.

19th February, 1667. I saw a comedy acted at Court. In the afternoon, I
witnessed a wrestling match for £1,000 in St. James's Park, before his
Majesty, a vast assemblage of lords and other spectators, between the
western and northern men, Mr. Secretary Morice and Lord Gerard being the
judges. The western men won. Many great sums were betted.

6th March, 1667. I proposed to my Lord Chancellor, Monsieur Kiviet's
undertaking to wharf the whole river of Thames, or quay, from the Temple
to the Tower, as far as the fire destroyed, with brick, without piles,
both lasting and ornamental.--Great frosts, snow and winds, prodigious
at the vernal equinox; indeed it had been a year of prodigies in this
nation, plague, war, fire, rain, tempest and comet.

14th March, 1667. Saw "The Virgin Queen,"[10] a play written by Mr.
Dryden.

    [Footnote 10: The VIRGIN QUEEN which Evelyn saw was Dryden's MAIDEN
    QUEEN. Pepys saw it on the night of its first production (twelve
    days before Evelyn's visit); and was charmed by Nell Gwynne's
    Florimell. "So great a performance of a comical part was never, I
    believe, in the world before."]

22d March, 1667. Dined at Mr. Secretary Morice's, who showed me his
library, which was a well chosen collection. This afternoon, I had
audience of his Majesty, concerning the proposal I had made of building
the quay.

26th March, 1667. Sir John Kiviet dined with me. We went to search for
brick-earth, in order to a great undertaking.

4th April, 1667. The cold so intense, that there was hardly a leaf on a
tree.

18th April, 1667. I went to make court to the Duke and Duchess of
Newcastle, at their house in Clerkenwell, being newly come out of the
north. They received me with great kindness, and I was much pleased with
the extraordinary fanciful habit, garb, and discourse of the Duchess.

22d April, 1667. Saw the sumptuous supper in the banqueting-house at
Whitehall, on the eve of St. George's day, where were all the companions
of the Order of the Garter.

23d April, 1667. In the morning, his Majesty went to chapel with the
Knights of the Garter, all in their habits and robes, ushered by the
heralds; after the first service, they went in procession, the youngest
first, the Sovereign last, with the Prelate of the Order and Dean, who
had about his neck the book of the Statutes of the Order; and then the
Chancellor of the Order (old Sir Henry de Vic), who wore the purse about
his neck; then the Heralds and Garter King-at-Arms, Clarencieux, Black
Rod. But before the Prelate and Dean of Windsor went the gentlemen of
the chapel and choristers, singing as they marched; behind them two
doctors of music in damask robes; this procession was about the courts
at Whitehall. Then, returning to their stalls and seats in the chapel,
placed under each knight's coat-armor and titles, the second service
began. Then, the King offered at the altar, an anthem was sung; then,
the rest of the Knights offered, and lastly proceeded to the
banqueting-house to a great feast. The King sat on an elevated throne at
the upper end at a table alone; the Knights at a table on the right
hand, reaching all the length of the room; over against them a cupboard
of rich gilded plate; at the lower end, the music; on the balusters
above, wind music, trumpets, and kettle-drums. The King was served by
the lords and pensioners who brought up the dishes. About the middle of
the dinner, the Knights drank the King's health, then the King, theirs,
when the trumpets and music played and sounded, the guns going off at
the Tower. At the Banquet, came in the Queen, and stood by the King's
left hand, but did not sit. Then was the banqueting-stuff flung about
the room profusely. In truth, the crowd was so great, that though I
stayed all the supper the day before, I now stayed no longer than this
sport began, for fear of disorder. The cheer was extraordinary, each
Knight having forty dishes to his mess, piled up five or six high; the
room hung with the richest tapestry.

25th April, 1667. Visited again the Duke of Newcastle, with whom I had
been acquainted long before in France, where the Duchess had obligation
to my wife's mother for her marriage there; she was sister to Lord
Lucas, and maid of honor then to the Queen-Mother; married in our chapel
at Paris. My wife being with me, the Duke and Duchess both would needs
bring her to the very Court.

26th April, 1667. My Lord Chancellor showed me all his newly finished
and furnished palace and library; then, we went to take the air in
Hyde-Park.

27th April, 1667. I had a great deal of discourse with his Majesty at
dinner. In the afternoon, I went again with my wife to the Duchess of
Newcastle, who received her in a kind of transport, suitable to her
extravagant humor and dress, which was very singular.

8th May, 1667. Made up accounts with our Receiver, which amounted to
£33,936 1s. 4d. Dined at Lord Cornbury's, with Don Francisco de Melos,
Portugal Ambassador, and kindred to the Queen: Of the party were Mr.
Henry Jermyn and Sir Henry Capel. Afterward I went to Arundel House, to
salute Mr. Howard's sons, newly returned out of France.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th May, 1667. To London; dined with the Duke of Newcastle, and sat
discoursing with her Grace in her bedchamber after dinner, till my Lord
Marquis of Dorchester, with other company came in, when I went away.

30th May, 1667. To London, to wait on the Duchess of Newcastle (who was
a mighty pretender to learning, poetry, and philosophy, and had in both
published divers books) to the Royal Society, whither she came in great
pomp, and being received by our Lord President at the door of our
meeting-room, the mace, etc., carried before him, had several
experiments shown to her. I conducted her Grace to her coach, and
returned home.

1st June, 1667. I went to Greenwich, where his Majesty was trying divers
grenadoes shot out of cannon at the Castlehill, from the house in the
park; they broke not till they hit the mark, the forged ones broke not
at all, but the cast ones very well. The inventor was a German there
present. At the same time, a ring was shown to the King, pretended to be
a projection of mercury, and malleable, and said by the gentlemen to be
fixed by the juice of a plant.

8th June, 1667. To London, alarmed by the Dutch, who were fallen on our
fleet at Chatham, by a most audacious enterprise, entering the very
river with part of their fleet, doing us not only disgrace, but
incredible mischief in burning several of our best men-of-war lying at
anchor and moored there, and all this through our unaccountable
negligence in not setting out our fleet in due time. This alarm caused
me, fearing the enemy might venture up the Thames even to London (which
they might have done with ease, and fired all the vessels in the river,
too), to send away my best goods, plate, etc., from my house to another
place. The alarm was so great that it put both country and city into
fear, panic, and consternation, such as I hope I shall never see more;
everybody was flying, none knew why or whither. Now, there were land
forces dispatched with the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Middleton, Prince
Rupert, and the Duke, to hinder the Dutch coming to Chatham, fortifying
Upnor Castle, and laying chains and bombs; but the resolute enemy broke
through all, and set fire on our ships, and retreated in spite, stopping
up the Thames, the rest of the fleet lying before the mouth of it.

14th June, 1667. I went to see the work at Woolwich, a battery to
prevent them coming up to London, which Prince Rupert commanded, and
sunk some ships in the river.

17th June, 1667. This night, about two o'clock, some chips and
combustible matter prepared for some fire-ships, taking flame in
Deptford-yard, made such a blaze, and caused such an uproar in the Tower
(it being given out that the Dutch fleet was come up, and had landed
their men and fired the Tower), as had liked to have done more mischief
before people would be persuaded to the contrary and believe the
accident. Everybody went to their arms. These were sad and troublesome
times.

24th June, 1667. The Dutch fleet still continuing to stop up the river,
so as nothing could stir out or come in, I was before the Council, and
commanded by his Majesty to go with some others and search about the
environs of the city, now exceedingly distressed for want of fuel,
whether there could be any peat, or turf, found fit for use. The next
day, I went and discovered enough, and made my report that there might
be found a great deal; but nothing further was done in it.

[Sidenote: CHATHAM]

28th June, 1667. I went to Chatham, and thence to view not only what
mischief the Dutch had done; but how triumphantly their whole fleet lay
within the very mouth of the Thames, all from the North Foreland,
Margate, even to the buoy of the Nore--a dreadful spectacle as ever
Englishmen saw, and a dishonor never to be wiped off! Those who advised
his Majesty to prepare no fleet this spring deserved--I know
what--but[11]--

    [Footnote 11: "The Parliament giving but weak supplies for the war,
    the King, to save charges, is persuaded by the Chancellor, the Lord
    Treasurer, Southampton, the Duke of Albemarle, and the other
    ministers, to lay up the first and second-rate ships, and make only
    a defensive war in the next campaign. The Duke of York opposed this,
    but was overruled." Life of King James II., vol. i., p. 425.]

Here in the river off Chatham, just before the town, lay the carcase of
the "London" (now the third time burnt), the "Royal Oak," the "James,"
etc., yet smoking; and now, when the mischief was done, we were making
trifling forts on the brink of the river. Here were yet forces, both of
horse and foot, with General Middleton continually expecting the motions
of the enemy's fleet. I had much discourse with him, who was an
experienced commander, I told him I wondered the King did not fortify
Sheerness[12] and the Ferry; both abandoned.

    [Footnote 12: Since done. Evelyn's note.]

2d July, 1667. Called upon my Lord Arlington, as from his Majesty, about
the new fuel. The occasion why I was mentioned, was from what I said in
my _Sylva_ three years before, about a sort of fuel for a need, which
obstructed a patent of Lord Carlingford, who had been seeking for it
himself; he was endeavoring to bring me into the project, and proffered
me a share. I met my Lord; and, on the 9th, by an order of Council, went
to my Lord Mayor, to be assisting. In the meantime they had made an
experiment of my receipt of _houllies_, which I mention in my book to be
made at Maestricht, with a mixture of charcoal dust and loam, and which
was tried with success at Gresham College (then being the exchange for
the meeting of the merchants since the fire) for everybody to see. This
done, I went to the Treasury for £12,000 for the sick and wounded yet on
my hands.

Next day, we met again about the fuel at Sir J. Armourer's in the Mews.

8th July, 1667. My Lord Brereton and others dined at my house, where I
showed them proof of my new fuel, which was very glowing, and without
smoke or ill smell.

10th July, 1667. I went to see Sir Samuel Morland's inventions and
machines, arithmetical wheels, quench-fires, and new harp.

17th July, 1667. The master of the mint and his lady, Mr. Williamson,
Sir Nicholas Armourer, Sir Edward Bowyer, Sir Anthony Auger, and other
friends dined with me.

19th July, 1667. I went to Gravesend; the Dutch fleet still at anchor
before the river, where I saw five of his Majesty's men-at-war encounter
above twenty of the Dutch, in the bottom of the Hope, chasing them with
many broadsides given and returned toward the buoy of the Nore, where
the body of their fleet lay, which lasted till about midnight. One of
their ships was fired, supposed by themselves, she being run on ground.
Having seen this bold action, and their braving us so far up the river,
I went home the next day, not without indignation at our negligence, and
the nation's reproach. It is well known who of the Commissioners of the
Treasury gave advice that the charge of setting forth a fleet this year
might be spared, Sir W. C. (William Coventry) by name.

1st August, 1667. I received the sad news of Abraham Cowley's death,
that incomparable poet and virtuous man, my very dear friend, and was
greatly deplored.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d August, 1667. Went to Mr. Cowley's funeral, whose corpse lay at
Wallingford House, and was thence conveyed to Westminster Abbey in a
hearse with six horses and all funeral decency, near a hundred coaches
of noblemen and persons of quality following; among these, all the wits
of the town, divers bishops and clergymen. He was interred next Geoffry
Chaucer, and near Spenser. A goodly monument is since erected to his
memory.

Now did his Majesty again dine in the presence, in ancient state, with
music and all the court ceremonies, which had been interrupted since the
late war.

8th August, 1667. Visited Mr. Oldenburg, a close prisoner in the Tower,
being suspected of writing intelligence. I had an order from Lord
Arlington, Secretary of State, which caused me to be admitted. This
gentleman was secretary to our Society, and I am confident will prove an
innocent person.

15th August, 1667. Finished my account, amounting to £25,000.

17th August, 1667. To the funeral of Mr. Farringdon, a relation of my
wife's.

There was now a very gallant horse to be baited to death with dogs; but
he fought them all, so as the fiercest of them could not fasten on him,
till the men run him through with their swords. This wicked and
barbarous sport deserved to have been punished in the cruel contrivers
to get money, under pretense that the horse had killed a man, which was
false. I would not be persuaded to be a spectator.

21st August, 1667. Saw the famous Italian puppet-play, for it was no
other.

24th August, 1667. I was appointed, with the rest of my brother
commissioners, to put in execution an order of Council for freeing the
prisoners at war in my custody at Leeds Castle, and taking off his
Majesty's extraordinary charge, having called before us the French and
Dutch agents. The peace was now proclaimed, in the usual form, by the
heralds-at-arms.

25th August, 1667. After evening service, I went to visit Mr. Vaughan,
who lay at Greenwich, a very wise and learned person, one of Mr.
Selden's executors and intimate friends.

27th August, 1667. Visited the Lord Chancellor, to whom his Majesty had
sent for the seals a few days before; I found him in his bedchamber,
very sad. The Parliament had accused him, and he had enemies at Court,
especially the buffoons and ladies of pleasure, because he thwarted some
of them, and stood in their way; I could name some of the chief. The
truth is, he made few friends during his grandeur among the royal
sufferers, but advanced the old rebels. He was, however, though no
considerable lawyer, one who kept up the form and substance of things in
the Nation with more solemnity than some would have had. He was my
particular kind friend, on all occasions. The cabal, however, prevailed,
and that party in Parliament. Great division at Court concerning him,
and divers great persons interceding for him.

28th August, 1667. I dined with my late Lord Chancellor, where also
dined Mr. Ashburnham, and Mr. W. Legge, of the bedchamber; his Lordship
pretty well in heart, though now many of his friends and sycophants
abandoned him.

In the afternoon, to the Lords Commissioners for money, and thence to
the audience of a Russian Envoy in the Queen's presence-chamber,
introduced with much state, the soldiers, pensioners, and guards in
their order. His letters of credence brought by his secretary in a scarf
of sarsenet, their vests sumptuous, much embroidered with pearls. He
delivered his speech in the Russ language, but without the least action,
or motion, of his body, which was immediately interpreted aloud by a
German that spoke good English: half of it consisted in repetition of
the Czar's titles, which were very haughty and oriental: the substance
of the rest was, that he was only sent to see the King and Queen, and
know how they did, with much compliment and frothy language. Then, they
kissed their Majesties' hands, and went as they came; but their real
errand was to get money.

29th August, 1667. We met at the Star-chamber about exchange and release
of prisoners.

7th September, 1667. Came Sir John Kiviet, to article with me about his
brickwork.

13th September, 1667. Between the hours of twelve and one, was born my
second daughter, who was afterward christened Elizabeth.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th September, 1667. To London, with Mr. Henry Howard, of Norfolk, of
whom I obtained the gift of his Arundelian marbles, those celebrated and
famous inscriptions, Greek and Latin, gathered with so much cost and
industry from Greece, by his illustrious grandfather, the magnificent
Earl of Arundel, my noble friend while he lived. When I saw these
precious monuments miserably neglected, and scattered up and down about
the garden, and other parts of Arundel House, and how exceedingly the
corrosive air of London impaired them, I procured him to bestow them on
the University of Oxford. This he was pleased to grant me; and now gave
me the key of the gallery, with leave to mark all those stones, urns,
altars, etc., and whatever I found had inscriptions on them, that were
not statues. This I did; and getting them removed and piled together,
with those which were incrusted in the garden walls, I sent immediately
letters to the Vice-Chancellor of what I had procured, and that if they
esteemed it a service to the University (of which I had been a member),
they should take order for their transportation.

This done 21st, I accompanied Mr. Howard to his villa at Albury, where I
designed for him the plot of his canal and garden, with a crypt through
the hill.

24th September, 1667. Returned to London, where I had orders to deliver
the possession of Chelsea College (used as my prison during the war with
Holland for such as were sent from the fleet to London) to our Society,
as a gift of his Majesty, our founder.

8th October, 1667. Came to dine with me Dr. Bathurst, Dean of Wells,
President of Trinity College, sent by the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, in
the name both of him and the whole University, to thank me for procuring
the inscriptions, and to receive my directions what was to be done to
show their gratitude to Mr. Howard.

11th October, 1667. I went to see Lord Clarendon, late Lord Chancellor
and greatest officer in England, in continual apprehension what the
Parliament would determine concerning him.

17th October, 1667. Came Dr. Barlow, Provost of Queen's College and
Protobibliothecus of the Bodleian library, to take order about the
transportation of the marbles.

25th October, 1667. There were delivered to me two letters from the
Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, with the Decree of the Convocation, attested
by the Public Notary, ordering four Doctors of Divinity and Law to
acknowledge the obligation the University had to me for procuring the
_Marmora Arundeliana_, which was solemnly done by Dr. Barlow, Dr.
Jenkins, Judge of the Admiralty, Dr. Lloyd, and Obadiah Walker, of
University College, who having made a large compliment from the
University, delivered me the decree fairly written;

    _Gesta venerabili domo Convocationis Universitatis Oxon.; . . 17.
    1667. Quo die retulit ad Senatum Academicum Dominus
    Vicecancellarius, quantum Universitas deberet singulari benevolentiæ
    Johannis Evelini Armigeri, qui pro eâ pietate quâ Almam Matrem
    prosequitur non solum Suasu et Consilio apud inclytum Heroem
    Henricum Howard, Ducis Norfolciæ hæredem, intercessit, et
    Universitati pretiosissimum eruditæ antiquitatis thesaurum Marmora
    Arundeliana largiretur; sed egregium insuper in ijs colligendis
    asservandisq; navavit operam: Quapropter unanimi suffragio
    Venerabilis Domûs decretum est, at eidem publicæ gratiæ per
    delegatos ad Honoratissimum Dominum Henricum Howard propediem
    mittendos solemnitèr reddantur.

    Concordant superscripta cum originali collatione fâcta per me Ben.
    Cooper,

    Notarium Publicum et Registarium Universitat Oxon._

    "SIR:

    "We intend also a noble inscription, in which also honorable mention
    shall be made of yourself; but Mr. Vice-Chancellor commands me to
    tell you that that was not sufficient for your merits; but, that if
    your occasions would permit you to come down at the Act (when we
    intend a dedication of our new Theater), some other testimony should
    be given both of your own worth and affection to this your old
    mother; for we are all very sensible that this great addition of
    learning and reputation to the University is due as well to your
    industrious care for the University, and interest with my Lord
    Howard, as to his great nobleness and generosity of spirit.

    "I am, Sir, your most humble servant,

    "OBADIAH WALKER, Univ. Coll."

The Vice-Chancellor's letter to the same effect was too vainglorious to
insert, with divers copies of verses that were also sent me. Their
mentioning me in the inscription I totally declined, when I directed the
titles of Mr. Howard, now made Lord, upon his Ambassage to Morocco.

These four doctors, having made me this compliment, desired me to carry
and introduce them to Mr. Howard, at Arundel House; which I did, Dr.
Barlow (Provost of Queen's) after a short speech, delivering a larger
letter of the University's thanks, which was written in Latin,
expressing the great sense they had of the honor done them. After this
compliment handsomely performed and as nobly received, Mr. Howard
accompanied the doctors to their coach. That evening I supped with them.

26th October, 1667. My late Lord Chancellor was accused by Mr. Seymour
in the House of Commons; and, in the evening, I returned home.

31st October, 1667. My birthday--blessed be God for all his mercies! I
made the Royal Society a present of the Table of Veins, Arteries, and
Nerves, which great curiosity I had caused to be made in Italy, out of
the natural human bodies, by a learned physician, and the help of
Veslingius (professor at Padua), from whence I brought them in 1646. For
this I received the public thanks of the Society; and they are hanging
up in their repository with an inscription.

9th December, 1667. To visit the late Lord Chancellor.[13] I found him
in his garden at his new-built palace, sitting in his gout wheel-chair,
and seeing the gates setting up toward the north and the fields. He
looked and spake very disconsolately. After some while deploring his
condition to me, I took my leave. Next morning, I heard he was gone;
though I am persuaded that, had he gone sooner, though but to Cornbury,
and there lain quiet, it would have satisfied the Parliament. That which
exasperated them was his presuming to stay and contest the accusation as
long as it was possible: and they were on the point of sending him to
the Tower.

    [Footnote 13: This entry of the 9th December, 1667, is a mistake.
    Evelyn could not have visited the "late Lord Chancellor" on that
    day. Lord Clarendon fled on Saturday, the 29th of November, 1667,
    and his letter resigning the Chancellorship of the University of
    Oxford is dated from Calais on the 7th of December. That Evelyn's
    book is not, in every respect, strictly a diary, is shown by this
    and several similar passages already adverted to in the remarks
    prefixed to the present edition. If the entry of the 18th of August,
    1683, is correct, the date of Evelyn's last visit to Lord Clarendon
    was the 28th of November, 1667.]

10th December, 1667. I went to the funeral of Mrs. Heath, wife of my
worthy friend and schoolfellow.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st December, 1667. I saw one Carr pilloried at Charing-cross for a
libel, which was burnt before him by the hangman.

8th January, 1667-68. I saw deep and prodigious gaming at the
Groom-Porter's, vast heaps of gold squandered away in a vain and profuse
manner. This I looked on as a horrid vice, and unsuitable in a Christian
Court.

9th January, 1668. Went to see the revels at the Middle Temple, which is
also an old riotous custom, and has relation neither to virtue nor
policy.

10th January, 1668. To visit Mr. Povey, where were divers great Lords to
see his well-contrived cellar, and other elegancies.

24th January, 1668. We went to stake out ground for building a college
for the Royal Society at Arundel-House, but did not finish it, which we
shall repent of.

4th February, 1668. I saw the tragedy of "Horace" (written by the
VIRTUOUS Mrs. Philips) acted before their Majesties. Between each act a
masque and antique dance. The excessive gallantry of the ladies was
infinite, those especially on that ... Castlemaine, esteemed at £40,000
and more, far outshining the Queen.

15th February, 1668. I saw the audience of the Swedish Ambassador Count
Donna, in great state in the banqueting house.

3d March, 1668. Was launched at Deptford, that goodly vessel, "The
Charles." I was near his Majesty. She is longer than the "Sovereign,"
and carries 110 brass cannon; she was built by old Shish, a plain,
honest carpenter, master-builder of this dock, but one who can give very
little account of his art by discourse, and is hardly capable of
reading, yet of great ability in his calling. The family have been ship
carpenters in this yard above 300 years.

12th March, 1668. Went to visit Sir John Cotton, who had me into his
library, full of good MSS., Greek and Latin, but most famous for those
of the Saxon and English antiquities, collected by his grandfather.

2d April, 1668. To the Royal Society, where I subscribed 50,000 bricks,
toward building a college. Among other libertine libels, there was one
now printed and thrown about, a bold petition of the poor w----s to Lady
Castlemaine.[14]

    [Footnote 14: Evelyn has been supposed himself to have written this
    piece.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th April, 1668. To London, about finishing my grand account of the sick
and wounded, and prisoners at war, amounting to above £34,000.

I heard Sir R. Howard impeach Sir William Penn, in the House of Lords,
for breaking bulk, and taking away rich goods out of the East India
prizes, formerly taken by Lord Sandwich.

28th April, 1668. To London, about the purchase of Ravensbourne Mills,
and land around it, in Upper Deptford, of one Mr. Becher.

30th April, 1668. We sealed the deeds in Sir Edward Thurland's chambers
in the Inner Temple. I pray God bless it to me, it being a dear
pennyworth; but the passion Sir R. Browne had for it, and that it was
contiguous to our other grounds, engaged me!

13th May, 1668. Invited by that expert commander, Captain Cox, master of
the lately built "Charles II.," now the best vessel of the fleet,
designed for the Duke of York, I went to Erith, where we had a great
dinner.

16th May, 1668. Sir Richard Edgecombe, of Mount Edgecombe, by Plymouth,
my relation, came to visit me; a very virtuous and worthy gentleman.

19th June, 1668. To a new play with several of my relations, "The
Evening Lover," a foolish plot, and very profane; it afflicted me to see
how the stage was degenerated and polluted by the licentious times.

2d July, 1668. Sir Samuel Tuke, Bart., and the lady he had married this
day, came and bedded at night at my house, many friends accompanying the
bride.

23d July, 1668. At the Royal Society, were presented divers _glossa
petras_, and other natural curiosities, found in digging to build the
fort at Sheerness. They were just the same as they bring from Malta,
pretending them to be viper's teeth, whereas, in truth, they are of a
shark, as we found by comparing them with one in our repository.

3d August, 1668. Mr. Bramstone (son to Judge B.), my old
fellow-traveler, now reader at the Middle Temple, invited me to his
feast, which was so very extravagant and great as the like had not been
seen at any time. There were the Duke of Ormond, Privy Seal, Bedford,
Belasis, Halifax, and a world more of Earls and Lords.

14th August, 1668. His Majesty was pleased to grant me a lease of a slip
of ground out of Brick Close, to enlarge my fore-court, for which I now
gave him thanks; then, entering into other discourse, he talked to me of
a new varnish for ships, instead of pitch, and of the gilding with which
his new yacht was beautified. I showed his Majesty the perpetual motion
sent to me by Dr. Stokes, from Cologne; and then came in Monsieur
Colbert, the French Ambassador.

19th August, 1668. I saw the magnificent entry of the French Ambassador
Colbert, received in the banqueting house. I had never seen a richer
coach than that which he came in to Whitehall. Standing by his Majesty
at dinner in the presence, there was of that rare fruit called the
king-pine, growing in Barbadoes and the West Indies; the first of them I
had ever seen. His Majesty having cut it up, was pleased to give me a
piece off his own plate to taste of; but, in my opinion, it falls short
of those ravishing varieties of deliciousness described in Captain
Ligon's history, and others; but possibly it might, or certainly was,
much impaired in coming so far; it has yet a grateful acidity, but
tastes more like the quince and melon than of any other fruit he
mentions.

28th August, 1668. Published my book on "The Perfection of Painting,"
dedicated to Mr. Howard.

17th September, 1668. I entertained Signor Muccinigo, the Venetian
Ambassador, of one of the noblest families of the State, this being the
day of making his public entry, setting forth from my house with several
gentlemen of Venice and others in a very glorious train. He staid with
me till the Earl of Anglesea and Sir Charles Cotterell (master of the
ceremonies) came with the King's barge to carry him to the Tower, where
the guns were fired at his landing; he then entered his Majesty's coach,
followed by many others of the nobility. I accompanied him to his house,
where there was a most noble supper to all the company, of course. After
the extraordinary compliments to me and my wife, for the civilities he
received at my house, I took leave and returned. He is a very
accomplished person. He is since Ambassador at Rome.

29th September, 1668. I had much discourse with Signor Pietro Cisij, a
Persian gentleman, about the affairs of Turkey, to my great
satisfaction. I went to see Sir Elias Leighton's project of a cart with
iron axletrees.

8th November, 1668. Being at dinner, my sister Evelyn sent for me to
come up to London to my continuing sick brother.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th November, 1668. To London, invited to the consecration of that
excellent person, the Dean of Ripon, Dr. Wilkins, now made Bishop of
Chester; it was at Ely House, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Cosin,
Bishop of Durham, the Bishops of Ely, Salisbury, Rochester, and others
officiating. Dr. Tillotson preached. Then, we went to a sumptuous dinner
in the hall, where were the Duke of Buckingham, Judges, Secretaries of
State, Lord-Keeper, Council, Noblemen, and innumerable other company,
who were honorers of this incomparable man, universally beloved by all
who knew him.

This being the Queen's birthday, great was the gallantry at Whitehall,
and the night celebrated with very fine fireworks.

My poor brother continuing ill, I went not from him till the 17th, when,
dining at the Groom Porters, I heard Sir Edward Sutton play excellently
on the Irish harp; he performs genteelly, but not approaching my worthy
friend, Mr. Clark, a gentleman of Northumberland, who makes it execute
lute, viol, and all the harmony an instrument is capable of; pity it is
that it is not more in use; but, indeed, to play well, takes up the
whole man, as Mr. Clark has assured me, who, though a gentleman of
quality and parts, was yet brought up to that instrument from five years
old, as I remember he told me.

25th November, 1668. I waited on Lord Sandwich, who presented me with a
Sembrador he brought out of Spain, showing me his two books of
observations made during his embassy and stay at Madrid, in which were
several rare things he promised to impart to me.

27th November, 1668. I dined at my Lord Ashley's (since Earl of
Shaftesbury), when the match of my niece was proposed for his only son,
in which my assistance was desired for my Lord.

28th November, 1668. Dr. Patrick preached at Convent Garden, on Acts
xvii. 31, the certainty of Christ's coming to judgment, it being Advent;
a most suitable discourse.

19th December, 1668. I went to see the old play of "Cataline" acted,
having been now forgotten almost forty years.

20th December, 1668. I dined with my Lord Cornbury, at Clarendon House,
now bravely furnished, especially with the pictures of most of our
ancient and modern wits, poets, philosophers, famous and learned
Englishmen; which collection of the Chancellor's I much commended, and
gave his Lordship a catalogue of more to be added.

31st December, 1668. I entertained my kind neighbors, according to
custom, giving Almighty God thanks for his gracious mercies to me the
past year.

1st January, 1669. Imploring his blessing for the year entering, I went
to church, where our Doctor preached on Psalm lxv. 12, apposite to the
season, and beginning a new year.

3d January, 1669. About this time one of Sir William Penn's sons had
published a blasphemous book against the Deity of our Blessed Lord.

29th January, 1669. I went to see a tall gigantic woman who measured 6
feet 10 inches high, at 21 years old, born in the Low Countries.

13th February, 1669. I presented his Majesty with my "History of the
Four Impostors;"[15] he told me of other like cheats. I gave my book to
Lord Arlington, to whom I dedicated it. It was now that he began to
tempt me about writing "The Dutch War."

    [Footnote 15: Reprinted in Evelyn's "Miscellaneous Writings."]

15th February, 1669. Saw Mrs. Phillips' "Horace" acted again.

18th February, 1669. To the Royal Society, when Signor Malpighi, an
Italian physician and anatomist, sent this learned body the incomparable
"History of the Silk-worm."

1st March, 1669. Dined at Lord Arlington's at Goring House, with the
Bishop of Hereford.

4th March, 1669. To the Council of the Royal Society, about disposing
my Lord Howard's library, now given to us.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th March, 1669. To London, to place Mr. Christopher Wase about my Lord
Arlington.

18th March, 1669. I went with Lord Howard of Norfolk, to visit Sir
William Ducie at Charlton, where we dined; the servants made our
coachmen so drunk, that they both fell off their boxes on the heath,
where we were fain to leave them, and were driven to London by two
servants of my Lord's. This barbarous custom of making the masters
welcome by intoxicating the servants, had now the second time happened
to my coachmen.

My son finally came from Oxford.

2d April, 1669. Dined at Mr. Treasurer's, where was (with many noblemen)
Colonel Titus of the bedchamber, author of the famous piece against
Cromwell, "Killing no Murder."

I now placed Mr. Wase with Mr. Williamson, Secretary to the Secretary of
State, and Clerk of the Papers.

14th April, 1669. I dined with the Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth,
and saw the library, which was not very considerable.

19th May, 1669. At a Council of the Royal Society our grant was
finished, in which his Majesty gives us Chelsea College, and some land
about it. It was ordered that five should be a quorum for a Council. The
Vice-President was then sworn for the first time, and it was proposed
how we should receive the Prince of Tuscany, who desired to visit the
Society.

20th May, 1669. This evening, at 10 o'clock, was born my third daughter,
who was baptized on the 25th by the name of Susannah.

3d June, 1669. Went to take leave of Lord Howard, going Ambassador to
Morocco. Dined at Lord Arlington's, where were the Earl of Berkshire,
Lord Saint John, Sir Robert Howard, and Sir R. Holmes.

10th June, 1669. Came my Lord Cornbury, Sir William Pulteney, and others
to visit me. I went this evening to London, to carry Mr. Pepys to my
brother Richard, now exceedingly afflicted with the stone, who had been
successfully cut, and carried the stone as big as a tennis ball to show
him, and encourage his resolution to go through the operation.

30th June, 1669. My wife went a journey of pleasure down the river as
far as the sea, with Mrs. Howard and her daughter, the Maid of Honor,
and others, among whom that excellent creature, Mrs. Blagg.[16]

    [Footnote 16: Afterward Mrs. Godolphin, whose life, written by
    Evelyn, has been published under the auspices of the Bishop of
    Oxford. The affecting circumstances of her death will be found
    recorded on pp. 126-27 of the present volume.]

7th July, 1669. I went toward Oxford; lay at Little Wycomb.

[Sidenote: OXFORD]

8th July, 1669. Oxford.

9th July, 1669. In the morning was celebrated the Encænia of the New
Theater, so magnificently built by the munificence of Dr. Gilbert
Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, in which was spent,£25,000, as Sir
Christopher Wren, the architect (as I remember), told me; and yet it was
never seen by the benefactor, my Lord Archbishop having told me that he
never did or ever would see it. It is, in truth, a fabric comparable to
any of this kind of former ages, and doubtless exceeding any of the
present, as this University does for colleges, libraries, schools,
students, and order, all the universities in the world. To the theater
is added the famous Sheldonian printing house. This being at the Act and
the first time of opening the Theater (Acts being formerly kept in St.
Mary's Church, which might be thought indecent, that being a place set
apart for the immediate worship of God, and was the inducement for
building this noble pile), it was now resolved to keep the present Act
in it, and celebrate its dedication with the greatest splendor and
formality that might be; and, therefore, drew a world of strangers, and
other company, to the University, from all parts of the nation.

The Vice-Chancellor, Heads of Houses, and Doctors, being seated in
magisterial seats, the Vice-Chancellor's chair and desk, Proctors, etc.,
covered with _brocatelle_ (a kind of brocade) and cloth of gold; the
University Registrar read the founder's grant and gift of it to the
University for their scholastic exercises upon these solemn occasions.
Then followed Dr. South, the University's orator, in an eloquent speech,
which was very long, and not without some malicious and indecent
reflections on the Royal Society, as underminers of the University;
which was very foolish and untrue, as well as unseasonable. But, to let
that pass from an ill-natured man, the rest was in praise of the
Archbishop and the ingenious architect. This ended, after loud music
from the corridor above, where an organ was placed, there followed
divers panegyric speeches, both in prose and verse, interchangeably
pronounced by the young students placed in the rostrums, in Pindarics,
Eclogues, Heroics, etc., mingled with excellent music, vocal and
instrumental, to entertain the ladies and the rest of the company. A
speech was then made in praise of academical learning. This lasted from
eleven in the morning till seven at night, which was concluded with
ringing of bells, and universal joy and feasting.

10th July, 1669. The next day began the more solemn lectures in all the
faculties, which were performed in the several schools, where all the
Inceptor-Doctors did their exercises, the Professors having first ended
their reading. The assembly now returned to the Theater, where the
_Terræ filius_ (the _University Buffoon_) entertained the auditory with
a tedious, abusive, sarcastical rhapsody, most unbecoming the gravity of
the University, and that so grossly, that unless it be suppressed, it
will be of ill consequence, as I afterward plainly expressed my sense of
it both to the Vice-Chancellor and several Heads of Houses, who were
perfectly ashamed of it, and resolved to take care of it in future. The
old facetious way of rallying upon the questions was left off, falling
wholly upon persons, so that it was rather licentious lying and railing
than genuine and noble wit. In my life, I was never witness of so
shameful an entertainment.

After this ribaldry, the Proctors made their speeches. Then began the
music art, vocal and instrumental, above in the balustrade corridor
opposite to the Vice-Chancellor's seat. Then Dr. Wallis, the
mathematical Professor, made his oration, and created one Doctor of
music according to the usual ceremonies of gown (which was of white
damask), cap, ring, kiss, etc. Next followed the disputations of the
Inceptor-Doctors in Medicine, the speech of their Professor, Dr. Hyde,
and so in course their respective creations. Then disputed the Inceptors
of Law, the speech of their Professor, and creation. Lastly, Inceptors
of Theology: Dr. Compton (brother of the Earl of Northampton) being
junior, began with great modesty and applause; so the rest. After which,
Dr. Tillotson, Dr. Sprat, etc., and then Dr. Allestree's speech, the
King's Professor, and their respective creations. Last of all, the
Vice-Chancellor, shutting up the whole in a panegyrical oration,
celebrating their benefactor and the rest, apposite to the occasion.

Thus was the Theater dedicated by the scholastic exercises in all the
Faculties with great solemnity; and the night, as the former,
entertaining the new Doctor's friends in feasting and music. I was
invited by Dr. Barlow, the worthy and learned Professor of Queen's
College.

11th July, 1669. The Act sermon was this forenoon preached by Dr. Hall,
in St. Mary's, in an honest, practical discourse against atheism. In the
afternoon, the church was so crowded, that, not coming early, I could
not approach to hear.

12th July, 1669. Monday. Was held the Divinity Act in the Theater again,
when proceeded seventeen Doctors, in all Faculties some.

13th July, 1669. I dined at the Vice-Chancellor's, and spent the
afternoon in seeing the rarities of the public libraries, and visiting
the noble marbles and inscriptions, now inserted in the walls that
compass the area of the Theater, which were 150 of the most ancient and
worthy treasures of that kind in the learned world. Now, observing that
people approach them too near, some idle persons began to scratch and
injure them, I advised that a hedge of holly should be planted at the
foot of the wall, to be kept breast-high only to protect them; which the
Vice-Chancellor promised to do the next season.

14th July, 1669. Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ Church and Vice-Chancellor,
with Dr. Allestree, Professor, with beadles and maces before them, came
to visit me at my lodging. I went to visit Lord Howard's sons at
Magdalen College.

15th July, 1669. Having two days before had notice that the University
intended me the honor of Doctorship, I was this morning attended by the
beadles belonging to the Law, who conducted me to the Theater, where I
found the Duke of Ormond (now Chancellor of the University) with the
Earl of Chesterfield and Mr. Spencer (brother to the late Earl of
Sunderland). Thence, we marched to the Convocation House, a convocation
having been called on purpose; here, being all of us robed in the porch,
in scarlet with caps and hoods, we were led in by the Professor of Laws,
and presented respectively by name, with a short eulogy, to the
Vice-Chancellor, who sat in the chair, with all the Doctors and Heads of
Houses and masters about the room, which was exceedingly full. Then,
began the Public Orator his speech, directed chiefly to the Duke of
Ormond, the Chancellor; but in which I had my compliment, in course.
This ended, we were called up, and created Doctors according to the
form, and seated by the Vice-Chancellor among the Doctors, on his right
hand; then, the Vice-Chancellor made a short speech, and so, saluting
our brother Doctors, the pageantry concluded, and the convocation was
dissolved. So formal a creation of honorary Doctors had seldom been
seen, that a convocation should be called on purpose, and speeches made
by the Orator; but they could do no less, their Chancellor being to
receive, or rather do them, this honor. I should have been made Doctor
with the rest at the public Act, but their expectation of their
Chancellor made them defer it. I was then led with my brother Doctors to
an extraordinary entertainment at Doctor Mewes's, head of St. John's
College, and, after abundance of feasting and compliments, having
visited the Vice-Chancellor and other Doctors, and given them thanks for
the honor done me, I went toward home the 16th, and got as far as
Windsor, and so to my house the next day.

4th August, 1669. I was invited by Sir Henry Peckham to his reading
feast in the Middle Temple, a pompous entertainment, where were the
Archbishop of Canterbury, all the great Earls and Lords, etc. I had much
discourse with my Lord Winchelsea, a prodigious talker; and the Venetian
Ambassador.

17th August, 1669. To London, spending almost the entire day in
surveying what progress was made in rebuilding the ruinous city, which
now began a little to revive after its sad calamity.

20th August, 1669. I saw the splendid audience of the Danish Ambassador
in the Banqueting House at Whitehall.

23d August, 1669. I went to visit my most excellent and worthy neighbor,
the Lord Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, which he was now repairing,
after the delapidations of the late Rebellion.

2d September, 1669. I was this day very ill of a pain in my limbs, which
continued most of this week, and was increased by a visit I made to my
old acquaintance, the Earl of Norwich, at his house in Epping Forest,
where are many good pictures put into the wainscot of the rooms, which
Mr. Baker, his Lordship's predecessor there, brought out of Spain;
especially the History of Joseph, a picture of the pious and learned
Picus Mirandula, and an incomparable one of old Breugel. The gardens
were well understood, I mean the _potager_. I returned late in the
evening, ferrying over the water at Greenwich.

26th September, 1669. To church, to give God thanks for my recovery.

3d October, 1669. I received the Blessed Eucharist, to my unspeakable
joy.

21st October, 1669. To the Royal Society, meeting for the first time
after a long recess, during vacation, according to custom; where was
read a description of the prodigious eruption of Mount Etna; and our
English itinerant presented an account of his autumnal peregrination
about England, for which we hired him, bringing dried fowls, fish,
plants, animals, etc.

26th October, 1669. My dear brother continued extremely full of pain,
the Lord be gracious to him!

3d November, 1669. This being the day of meeting for the poor, we dined
neighborly together.

26th November, 1669. I heard an excellent discourse by Dr. Patrick, on
the Resurrection, and afterward, visited the Countess of Kent, my
kinswoman.

8th December, 1669. To London, upon the second edition of my "Sylva,"
which I presented to the Royal Society.

6th February, 1669-70. Dr. John Breton, Master of Emmanuel College, in
Cambridge (uncle to our vicar), preached on John i. 27; "whose
shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose," etc., describing the various
fashions of shoes, or sandals, worn by the Jews, and other nations: of
the ornaments of the feet: how great persons had servants that took them
off when they came to their houses, and bore them after them: by which
pointing the dignity of our Savior, when such a person as St. John
Baptist acknowledged his unworthiness even of that mean office. The
lawfulness, decentness, and necessity, of subordinate degrees and ranks
of men and servants, as well in the Church as State: against the late
levelers, and others of that dangerous rabble, who would have all alike.

3d March, 1670. Finding my brother [Richard] in such exceeding torture,
and that he now began to fall into convulsion-fits, I solemnly set the
next day apart to beg of God to mitigate his sufferings, and prosper the
only means which yet remained for his recovery, he being not only much
wasted, but exceedingly and all along averse from being cut (for the
stone); but, when he at last consented, and it came to the operation,
and all things prepared, his spirit and resolution failed.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th March, 1670. Dr. Patrick preached in Covent Garden Church. I
participated of the Blessed Sacrament, recommending to God the
deplorable condition of my dear brother, who was almost in the last
agonies of death. I watched late with him this night. It pleased God to
deliver him out of this miserable life, toward five o'clock this Monday
morning, to my unspeakable grief. He was a brother whom I most dearly
loved, for his many virtues; but two years younger than myself, a sober,
prudent, worthy gentleman. He had married a great fortune, and left one
only daughter, and a noble seat at Woodcot, near Epsom. His body was
opened, and a stone taken out of his bladder, not much bigger than a
nutmeg. I returned home on the 8th, full of sadness, and to bemoan my
loss.

20th March, 1670. A stranger preached at the Savoy French church; the
Liturgy of the Church of England being now used altogether, as
translated into French by Dr. Durell.

21st March, 1670. We all accompanied the corpse of my dear brother to
Epsom Church, where he was decently interred in the chapel belonging to
Woodcot House. A great number of friends and gentlemen of the country
attended, about twenty coaches and six horses, and innumerable people.

22d March, 1670. I went to Westminster, where in the House of Lords I
saw his Majesty sit on his throne, but without his robes, all the peers
sitting with their hats on; the business of the day being the divorce of
my Lord Ross. Such an occasion and sight had not been seen in England
since the time of Henry VIII.[17]

    [Footnote 17: Evelyn subjoins in a note: "When there was a project,
    1669, for getting a divorce for the King, to facilitate it there was
    brought into the House of Lords a bill for dissolving the marriage
    of Lord Ross, on account of adultery, and to give him leave to marry
    again. This Bill, after great debates, passed by the plurality of
    only two votes, and that by the great industry of the Lord's
    friends, as well as the Duke's enemies, who carried it on chiefly in
    hopes it might be a precedent and inducement for the King to enter
    the more easily into their late proposals; nor were they a little
    encouraged therein, when they saw the King countenance and drive on
    the Bill in Lord Ross's favor. Of eighteen bishops that were in the
    House, only two voted for the bill, of which one voted through age,
    and one was reputed Socinian." The two bishops favorable to the bill
    were Dr. Cosin, Bishop of Durham, and Dr. Wilkins, Bishop of
    Chester.]

5th May, 1670. To London, concerning the office of Latin Secretary to
his Majesty, a place of more honor and dignity than profit, the
reversion of which he had promised me.

21st May, 1670. Came to visit me Mr. Henry Saville, and Sir Charles
Scarborough.

26th May, 1670. Receiving a letter from Mr. Philip Howard, Lord Almoner
to the Queen, that Monsieur Evelin, first physician to Madame (who was
now come to Dover to visit the King her brother), was come to town,
greatly desirous to see me; but his stay so short, that he could not
come to me, I went with my brother to meet him at the Tower, where he
was seeing the magazines and other curiosities, having never before been
in England: we renewed our alliance and friendship, with much regret on
both sides that, he being to return toward Dover that evening, we could
not enjoy one another any longer. How this French family, Ivelin, of
Evelin, Normandy, a very ancient and noble house is grafted into our
pedigree, see in the collection brought from Paris, 1650.

16th June, 1670. I went with some friends to the Bear Garden, where was
cock-fighting, dog-fighting, bear and bull-baiting, it being a famous
day for all these butcherly sports, or rather barbarous cruelties. The
bulls did exceedingly well, but the Irish wolf dog exceeded, which was a
tall greyhound, a stately creature indeed, who beat a cruel mastiff. One
of the bulls tossed a dog full into a lady's lap as she sat in one of
the boxes at a considerable height from the arena. Two poor dogs were
killed, and so all ended with the ape on horseback, and I most heartily
weary of the rude and dirty pastime, which I had not seen, I think, in
twenty years before.

18th June, 1670. Dined at Goring House, whither my Lord Arlington
carried me from Whitehall with the Marquis of Worcester; there, we found
Lord Sandwich, Viscount Stafford,[18] the Lieutenant of the Tower, and
others. After dinner, my Lord communicated to me his Majesty's desire
that I would engage to write the history of our late war with the
Hollanders, which I had hitherto declined; this I found was ill taken,
and that I should disoblige his Majesty, who had made choice of me to do
him this service, and, if I would undertake it, I should have all the
assistance the Secretary's office and others could give me, with other
encouragements, which I could not decently refuse.

    [Footnote 18: Sir William Howard, created in November, 1640,
    Viscount Stafford. In 1678, he was accused of complicity with the
    Popish Plot, and upon trial by his Peers in Westminster Hall, was
    found guilty, by a majority of twenty-four. He was beheaded,
    December 29, 1680, on Tower Hill.]

Lord Stafford rose from the table, in some disorder, because there were
roses stuck about the fruit when the dessert was set on the table; such
an antipathy, it seems, he had to them as once Lady Selenger also had,
and to that degree that, as Sir Kenelm Digby tells us, laying but a rose
upon her cheek when she was asleep, it raised a blister: but Sir Kenelm
was a teller of strange things.

24th June, 1670. Came the Earl of Huntington and Countess, with the Lord
Sherard, to visit us.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th June, 1670. To London, in order to my niece's marriage, Mary,
daughter to my late brother Richard, of Woodcot, with the eldest son of
Mr. Attorney Montague, which was celebrated at Southampton-House chapel,
after which a magnificent entertainment, feast, and dancing, dinner and
supper, in the great room there; but the bride was bedded at my sister's
lodging, in Drury-Lane.

6th July, 1670. Came to visit me Mr. Stanhope, gentleman-usher to her
Majesty, and uncle to the Earl of Chesterfield, a very fine man, with my
Lady Hutcheson.

19th July, 1670. I accompanied my worthy friend, that excellent man, Sir
Robert Murray, with Mr. Slingsby, master of the mint, to see the
latter's seat and estate at Burrow-Green in Cambridgeshire, he desiring
our advice for placing a new house, which he was resolved to build. We
set out in a coach and six horses with him and his lady, dined about
midway at one Mr. Turner's, where we found a very noble dinner, venison,
music, and a circle of country ladies and their gallants. After dinner,
we proceeded, and came to Burrow-Green that night. This had been the
ancient seat of the Cheekes (whose daughter Mr. Slingsby married),
formerly tutor to King Henry VI. The old house large and ample, and
built for ancient hospitality, ready to fall down with age, placed in a
dirty hole, a stiff clay, no water, next an adjoining church-yard, and
with other inconveniences. We pitched on a spot of rising ground,
adorned with venerable woods, a dry and sweet prospect east and west,
and fit for a park, but no running water; at a mile distance from the
old house.

20th July, 1670. We went to dine at Lord Allington's, who had newly
built a house of great cost, I believe a little less than £20,000. His
architect was Mr. Pratt. It is seated in a park, with a sweet prospect
and stately avenue; but water still defective; the house has also its
infirmities. Went back to Mr. Slingsby's.

[Sidenote: NEWMARKET]

22d July, 1670. We rode out to see the great mere, or level, of
recovered fen land, not far off. In the way, we met Lord Arlington going
to his house in Suffolk, accompanied with Count Ogniati, the Spanish
minister, and Sir Bernard Gascoigne; he was very importunate with me to
go with him to Euston, being but fifteen miles distant; but, in regard
of my company, I could not. So, passing through Newmarket, we alighted
to see his Majesty's house there, now new-building; the arches of the
cellars beneath are well turned by Mr. Samuel, the architect, the rest
mean enough, and hardly fit for a hunting house. Many of the rooms above
had the chimneys in the angles and corners, a mode now introduced by his
Majesty, which I do at no hand approve of. I predict it will spoil many
noble houses and rooms, if followed. It does only well in very small and
trifling rooms, but takes from the state of greater. Besides, this house
is placed in a dirty street, without any court or avenue, like a common
one, whereas it might and ought to have been built at either end of the
town, upon the very carpet where the sports are celebrated; but, it
being the purchase of an old wretched house of my Lord Thomond's, his
Majesty was persuaded to set it on that foundation, the most improper
imaginable for a house of sport and pleasure.

We went to see the stables and fine horses, of which many were here kept
at a vast expense, with all the art and tenderness imaginable.

Being arrived at some meres, we found Lord Wotton and Sir John Kiviet
about their draining engines, having, it seems, undertaken to do wonders
on a vast piece of marsh-ground they had hired of Sir Thomas Chicheley
(master of the ordnance). They much pleased themselves with the hopes of
a rich harvest of hemp and coleseed, which was the crop expected.

Here we visited the engines and mills both for wind and water, draining
it through two rivers or graffs, cut by hand, and capable of carrying
considerable barges, which went thwart one the other, discharging the
water into the sea. Such this spot had been the former winter; it was
astonishing to see it now dry, and so rich that weeds grew on the banks,
almost as high as a man and horse. Here, my Lord and his partner had
built two or three rooms, with Flanders white bricks, very hard. One of
the great engines was in the kitchen, where I saw the fish swim up, even
to the very chimney hearth, by a small cut through the room, and running
within a foot of the very fire.

Having, after dinner, ridden about that vast level, pestered with heat
and swarms of gnats, we returned over Newmarket Heath, the way being
mostly a sweet turf and down, like Salisbury Plain, the jockeys
breathing their fine barbs and racers and giving them their heats.

23d July, 1670. We returned from Burrow Green to London, staying some
time at Audley End to see that fine palace. It is indeed a cheerful
piece of Gothic building, or rather _antico moderno_, but placed in an
obscure bottom. The cellars and galleries are very stately. It has a
river by it, a pretty avenue of limes, and in a park.

This is in Saffron Walden parish, famous for that useful plant, with
which all the country is covered.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

Dining at Bishop Stortford, we came late to London.

5th August, 1670. There was sent me by a neighbor a servant maid, who,
in the last month, as she was sitting before her mistress at work, felt
a stroke on her arm a little above the wrist for some height, the smart
of which, as if struck by another hand, caused her to hold her arm
awhile till somewhat mitigated; but it put her into a kind of
convulsion, or rather hysteric fit. A gentleman coming casually in,
looking on her arm, found that part powdered with red crosses, set in
most exact and wonderful order, neither swelled nor depressed, about
this shape,

          x
      x       x
    x     x     x
      x       x
          x

not seeming to be any way made by artifice, of a reddish color, not so
red as blood, the skin over them smooth, the rest of the arm livid and
of a mortified hue, with certain prints, as it were, of the stroke of
fingers. This had happened three several times in July, at about ten
days' interval, the crosses beginning to wear out, but the successive
ones set in other different, yet uniform order. The maid seemed very
modest, and came from London to Deptford with her mistress, to avoid the
discourse and importunity of curious people. She made no gain by it,
pretended no religious fancies; but seemed to be a plain, ordinary,
silent, working wench, somewhat fat, short, and high-colored. She told
me divers divines and physicians had seen her, but were unsatisfied;
that she had taken some remedies against her fits, but they did her no
good; she had never before had any fits; once since, she seemed in her
sleep to hear one say to her that she should tamper no more with them,
nor trouble herself with anything that happened, but put her trust in
the merits of Christ only.

This is the substance of what she told me, and what I saw and curiously
examined. I was formerly acquainted with the impostorious nuns of
Loudun, in France, which made such noise among the Papists; I therefore
thought this worth the notice. I remember Monsieur Monconys[19] (that
curious traveler and a Roman Catholic) was by no means satisfied with
the _stigmata_ of those nuns, because they were so shy of letting him
scrape the letters, which were Jesus, Maria, Joseph (as I think),
observing they began to scale off with it, whereas this poor wench was
willing to submit to any trial; so that I profess I know not what to
think of it, nor dare I pronounce it anything supernatural.

    [Footnote 19: Balthasar de Monconys, a Frenchman, celebrated for his
    travels in the East, which he published in three volumes. His object
    was to discover vestiges of the philosophy of Trismegistus and
    Zoroaster; in which, it is hardly necessary to add, he was not very
    successful.]

20th August, 1670. At Windsor I supped with the Duke of Monmouth; and,
the next day, invited by Lord Arlington, dined with the same Duke and
divers Lords. After dinner my Lord and I had a conference of more than
an hour alone in his bedchamber, to engage me in the History. I showed
him something that I had drawn up, to his great satisfaction, and he
desired me to show it to the Treasurer.

28th August, 1670. One of the Canons preached; then followed the
offering of the Knights of the Order, according to custom; first the
poor Knights, in procession, then, the Canons in their formalities, the
Dean and Chancellor, then his Majesty (the Sovereign), the Duke of York,
Prince Rupert; and, lastly, the Earl of Oxford, being all the Knights
that were then at Court.

I dined with the Treasurer, and consulted with him what pieces I was to
add; in the afternoon the King took me aside into the balcony over the
terrace, extremely pleased with what had been told him I had begun, in
order to his commands, and enjoining me to proceed vigorously in it. He
told me he had ordered the Secretaries of State to give me all necessary
assistance of papers and particulars relating to it and enjoining me to
make it a LITTLE KEEN, for that the Hollanders had very unhandsomely
abused him in their pictures, books, and libels.

Windsor was now going to be repaired, being exceedingly ragged and
ruinous. Prince Rupert, the Constable, had begun to trim up the keep or
high round Tower, and handsomely adorned his hall with furniture of
arms, which was very singular, by so disposing the pikes, muskets,
pistols, bandoleers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and headpieces, as
was very extraordinary. Thus, those huge steep stairs ascending to it
had the walls invested with this martial furniture, all new and bright,
so disposing the bandoleers, holsters, and drums, as to represent
festoons, and that without any confusion, trophy-like. From the hall we
went into his bedchamber, and ample rooms hung with tapestry, curious
and effeminate pictures, so extremely different from the other, which
presented nothing but war and horror.

The King passed most of his time in hunting the stag, and walking in the
park, which he was now planting with rows of trees.

13th September, 1670. To visit Sir Richard Lashford, my kinsman, and Mr.
Charles Howard, at his extraordinary garden, at Deepden.

15th September, 1670. I went to visit Mr. Arthur Onslow, at West
Clandon, a pretty dry seat on the Downs, where we dined in his great
room.

17th September, 1670. To visit Mr. Hussey, who, being near Wotton, lives
in a sweet valley, deliciously watered.

23d September, 1670. To Albury, to see how that garden proceeded, which
I found exactly done to the design and plot I had made, with the crypta
through the mountain in the park, thirty perches in length. Such a
Pausilippe[20] is nowhere in England. The canal was now digging, and the
vineyard planted.

    [Footnote 20: A word adopted by Evelyn for a subterranean passage,
    from the famous grot of Pausilippo, at Naples.]

14th October, 1670. I spent the whole afternoon in private with the
Treasurer who put into my hands those secret pieces and transactions
concerning the Dutch war, and particularly the expedition of Bergen, in
which he had himself the chief part, and gave me instructions, till the
King arriving from Newmarket, we both went up into his bedchamber.

21st October, 1670. Dined with the Treasurer; and, after dinner, we
were shut up together. I received other [further] advices, and ten paper
books of dispatches and treaties; to return which again I gave a note
under my hand to Mr. Joseph Williamson, Master of the Paper office.

31st October, 1670. I was this morning fifty years of age; the Lord
teach me to number my days so as to apply them to his glory! Amen.

4th November, 1670. Saw the Prince of Orange, newly come to see the
King, his uncle; he has a manly, courageous, wise countenance,
resembling his mother and the Duke of Gloucester, both deceased.

I now also saw that famous beauty, but in my opinion of a childish,
simple, and baby face, Mademoiselle Querouaille,[21] lately Maid of
Honor to Madame, and now to be so to the Queen.

    [Footnote 21: Henrietta, the King's sister, married to Philip, Duke
    of Orleans, was then on a visit here. Madame Querouaille came over
    in her train, on purpose to entice Charles into an union with Louis
    XIV.; a design which unhappily succeeded but too well. She became
    the King's mistress, was made Duchess of Portsmouth, and was his
    favorite till his death.]

23d November, 1670. Dined with the Earl of Arlington, where was the
Venetian Ambassador, of whom I now took solemn leave, now on his return.
There were also Lords Howard, Wharton, Windsor, and divers other great
persons.

24th November, 1670. I dined with the Treasurer, where was the Earl of
Rochester, a very profane wit.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th December, 1670. It was the thickest and darkest fog on the Thames
that was ever known in the memory of man, and I happened to be in the
very midst of it. I supped with Monsieur Zulestein, late Governor to the
late Prince of Orange.

10th January, 1670-71. Mr. Bohun, my son's tutor, had been five years in
my house, and now Bachelor of Laws, and Fellow of New College, went from
me to Oxford to reside there, having well and faithfully performed his
charge.

18th January, 1671. This day I first acquainted his Majesty with that
incomparable young man, Gibbon,[22] whom I had lately met with in an
obscure place by mere accident, as I was walking near a poor solitary
thatched house, in a field in our parish, near Sayes Court. I found him
shut in; but looking in at the window, I perceived him carving that
large cartoon, or crucifix, of Tintoretto, a copy of which I had myself
brought from Venice, where the original painting remains. I asked if I
might enter; he opened the door civilly to me, and I saw him about such
a work as for the curiosity of handling, drawing, and studious
exactness, I never had before seen in all my travels. I questioned him
why he worked in such an obscure and lonesome place; he told me it was
that he might apply himself to his profession without interruption, and
wondered not a little how I found him out. I asked if he was unwilling
to be made known to some great man, for that I believed it might turn to
his profit; he answered, he was yet but a beginner, but would not be
sorry to sell off that piece; on demanding the price, he said £100. In
good earnest, the very frame was worth the money, there being nothing in
nature so tender and delicate as the flowers and festoons about it, and
yet the work was very strong; in the piece was more than one hundred
figures of men, etc. I found he was likewise musical, and very civil,
sober, and discreet in his discourse. There was only an old woman in the
house. So, desiring leave to visit him sometimes, I went away.

    [Footnote 22: Better known by the name of Grinling Gibbon;
    celebrated for his exquisite carving. Some of his most astonishing
    work is at Chatsworth and at Petworth.]

Of this young artist, together with my manner of finding him out, I
acquainted the King, and begged that he would give me leave to bring him
and his work to Whitehall, for that I would adventure my reputation with
his Majesty that he had never seen anything approach it, and that he
would be exceedingly pleased, and employ him. The King said he would
himself go see him. This was the first notice his Majesty ever had of
Mr. Gibbon.

20th January, 1671. The King came to me in the Queen's withdrawing-room
from the circle of ladies, to talk with me as to what advance I had made
in the Dutch History. I dined with the Treasurer, and afterward we went
to the Secretary's Office, where we conferred about divers particulars.

21st January, 1671. I was directed to go to Sir George Downing, who
having been a public minister in Holland, at the beginning of the war,
was to give me light in some material passages.

This year the weather was so wet, stormy, and unseasonable, as had not
been known in many years.

9th February, 1671. I saw the great ball danced by the Queen and
distinguished ladies at Whitehall Theater. Next day; was acted there the
famous play, called, "The Siege of Granada," two days acted
successively; there were indeed very glorious scenes and perspectives,
the work of Mr. Streeter, who well understands it.[23]

    [Footnote 23: Evelyn here refers to Dryden's "Conquest of Granada".]

19th February, 1671. This day dined with me Mr. Surveyor, Dr.
Christopher Wren, and Mr. Pepys, Clerk of the Acts, two extraordinary,
ingenious, and knowing persons, and other friends. I carried them to see
the piece of carving which I had recommended to the King.

25th February, 1671. Came to visit me one of the Lords Commissioners of
Scotland for the Union.

28th February, 1671. The Treasurer acquainted me that his Majesty was
graciously pleased to nominate me one of the Council of Foreign
Plantations, and give me a salary of £500 per annum, to encourage me.

29th February, 1671. I went to thank the Treasurer, who was my great
friend and loved me; I dined with him and much company, and went thence
to my Lord Arlington, Secretary of State, in whose favor I likewise was
upon many occasions, though I cultivated neither of their friendships by
any mean submissions. I kissed his Majesty's hand, on his making me one
of the new-established Council.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st March, 1671. I caused Mr. Gibbon to bring to Whitehall his
excellent piece of carving, where being come, I advertised his Majesty,
who asked me where it was; I told him in Sir Richard Browne's (my
father-in-law) chamber, and that if it pleased his Majesty to appoint
whither it should be brought, being large and though of wood, heavy, I
would take care for it. "No," says the King, "show me the way, I'll go
to Sir Richard's chamber," which he immediately did, walking along the
entries after me; as far as the ewry, till he came up into the room,
where I also lay. No sooner was he entered and cast his eyes on the
work, but he was astonished at the curiosity of it; and having
considered it a long time, and discoursed with Mr. Gibbon, whom I
brought to kiss his hand, he commanded it should be immediately carried
to the Queen's side to show her. It was carried up into her bedchamber,
where she and the King looked on and admired it again; the King, being
called away, left us with the Queen, believing she would have bought it,
it being a crucifix; but, when his Majesty was gone, a French peddling
woman, one Madame de Boord, who used to bring petticoats and fans, and
baubles, out of France to the ladies, began to find fault with several
things in the work, which she understood no more than an ass, or a
monkey, so as in a kind of indignation, I caused the person who brought
it to carry it back to the chamber, finding the Queen so much governed
by an ignorant Frenchwoman, and this incomparable artist had his labor
only for his pains, which not a little displeased me; and he was fain to
send it down to his cottage again; he not long after sold it for £80,
though well worth £100, without the frame, to Sir George Viner.

His Majesty's Surveyor, Mr. Wren, faithfully promised me to employ
him.[24] I having also bespoke his Majesty for his work at Windsor,
which my friend, Mr. May, the architect there, was going to alter, and
repair universally; for, on the next day, I had a fair opportunity of
talking to his Majesty about it, in the lobby next the Queen's side,
where I presented him with some sheets of my history. I thence walked
with him through St. James's Park to the garden, where I both saw and
heard a very familiar discourse between ... and Mrs. Nelly,[25] as they
called an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden on a terrace
at the top of the wall, and ... standing on the green walk under it. I
was heartily sorry at this scene. Thence the King walked to the Duchess
of Cleveland, another lady of pleasure, and curse of our nation.

    [Footnote 24: The carving in the choir, etc., of St. Paul's
    Cathedral was executed by Gibbon.]

    [Footnote 25: Nell Gwynne: there can be no doubt as to the name with
    which we are to fill up these blanks. This familiar interview of
    Nelly and the King has afforded a subject for painters.]

5th March, 1671. I dined at Greenwich, to take leave of Sir Thomas
Linch, going Governor of Jamaica.

10th March, 1671. To London, about passing my patent as one of the
standing Council for Plantations, a considerable honor, the others in
the Council being chiefly noblemen and officers of state.

[Illustration: _NELL GWYNNE_

_Photogravure after Sir Peter Lely_]

2d April, 1671. To Sir Thomas Clifford, the Treasurer, to condole with
him on the loss of his eldest son, who died at Florence.

2d May, 1671. The French King, being now with a great army of 28,000 men
about Dunkirk, divers of the grandees of that Court, and a vast number
of gentlemen and cadets, in fantastical habits, came flocking over to
see our Court and compliment his Majesty. I was present, when they first
were conducted into the Queen's withdrawing-room, where saluted their
Majesties the Dukes of Guise, Longueville, and many others of the first
rank.

10th May, 1671. Dined at Mr. Treasurer's,[26] in company with Monsieur
De Grammont and several French noblemen, and one Blood, that impudent,
bold fellow who had not long before attempted to steal the imperial
crown itself out of the Tower, pretending only curiosity of seeing the
regalia there, when, stabbing the keeper, though not mortally, he boldly
went away with it through all the guards, taken only by the accident of
his horse falling down. How he came to be pardoned, and even received
into favor, not only after this, but several other exploits almost as
daring both in Ireland and here, I could never come to understand. Some
believed he became a spy of several parties, being well with the
sectaries and enthusiasts, and did his Majesty services that way, which
none alive could do so well as he; but it was certainly the boldest
attempt, so the only treason of this sort that was ever pardoned. This
man had not only a daring but a villanous, unmerciful look, a false
countenance, but very well-spoken and dangerously insinuating.

    [Footnote 26: This entry of 10th May, 1671, so far as it relates to
    Blood, and the stealing of the crown, etc., is a mistake. Blood
    stole the crown on the 9th of May, 1671--the very day before; and
    the "not long before" of Evelyn, and the circumstance of his being
    "pardoned," which Evelyn also mentions, can hardly be said to relate
    to only the day before.]

11th May, 1671. I went to Eltham, to sit as one of the commissioners
about the subsidy now given by Parliament to his Majesty.

17th May, 1671. Dined at Mr. Treasurer's [Sir Thomas Clifford] with
the Earl of Arlington, Carlingford, Lord Arundel of Wardour, Lord
Almoner to the Queen, a French Count and two abbots, with several more
of French nobility; and now by something I had lately observed of Mr.
Treasurer's conversation on occasion, I suspected him a little warping
to Rome.

25th May, 1671. I dined at a feast made for me and my wife by the
Trinity Company, for our passing a fine of the land which Sir R. Browne,
my wife's father, freely gave to found and build their college, or
almshouses on, at Deptford, it being my wife's after her father's
decease. It was a good and charitable work and gift, but would have been
better bestowed on the poor of that parish, than on the seamen's widows,
the Trinity Company being very rich, and the rest of the poor of the
parish exceedingly indigent.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th May, 1671. The Earl of Bristol's house in Queen's Street
[Lincoln's Inn Fields] was taken for the Commissioners of Trade and
Plantations, and furnished with rich hangings of the King's. It
consisted of seven rooms on a floor, with a long gallery, gardens, etc.
This day we met the Duke of Buckingham, Earl of Lauderdale, Lord
Culpeper, Sir George Carteret, Vice-Chamberlain, and myself, had the
oaths given us by the Earl of Sandwich, our President. It was to advise
and counsel his Majesty, to the best of our abilities, for the
well-governing of his Foreign Plantations, etc., the form very little
differing from that given to the Privy Council. We then took our places
at the Board in the Council-Chamber, a very large room furnished with
atlases, maps, charts, globes, etc. Then came the Lord Keeper, Sir
Orlando Bridgeman, Earl of Arlington, Secretary of State, Lord Ashley,
Mr. Treasurer, Sir John Trevor, the other Secretary, Sir John Duncomb,
Lord Allington, Mr. Grey, son to the Lord Grey, Mr. Henry Broncher, Sir
Humphrey Winch, Sir John Finch, Mr. Waller, and Colonel Titus, of the
bedchamber, with Mr. Slingsby, Secretary to the Council, and two Clerks
of the Council, who had all been sworn some days before. Being all set,
our Patent was read, and then the additional Patent, in which was
recited this new establishment; then, was delivered to each a copy of
the Patent, and of instructions: after which, we proceeded to business.

The first thing we did was, to settle the form of a circular letter to
the Governors of all his Majesty's Plantations and Territories in the
West Indies and Islands thereof, to give them notice to whom they should
apply themselves on all occasions, and to render us an account of their
present state and government; but, what we most insisted on was, to know
the condition of New England, which appearing to be very independent as
to their regard to Old England, or his Majesty, rich and strong as they
now were, there were great debates in what style to write to them; for
the condition of that Colony was such, that they were able to contest
with all other Plantations about them, and there was fear of their
breaking from all dependence on this nation; his Majesty, therefore,
commended this affair more expressly. We, therefore, thought fit, in the
first place, to acquaint ourselves as well as we could of the state of
that place, by some whom we heard of that were newly come from thence,
and to be informed of their present posture and condition; some of our
Council were for sending them a menacing letter, which those who better
understood the peevish and touchy humor of that Colony, were utterly
against.

A letter was then read from Sir Thomas Modiford, Governor of Jamaica;
and then the Council broke up.

Having brought an action against one Cocke, for money which he had
received for me, it had been referred to an arbitration by the
recommendation of that excellent good man, the Chief-Justice Hale,[27]
but, this not succeeding, I went to advise with that famous lawyer, Mr.
Jones, of Gray's Inn, and, 27th of May, had a trial before Lord Chief
Justice Hale; and, after the lawyers had wrangled sufficiently, it was
referred to a new arbitration. This was the very first suit at law that
ever I had with any creature, and oh, that it might be the last!

    [Footnote 27: Sir Matthew Hale, so famous as one of the justices of
    the bench in Cromwell's time. After the Restoration, he became Chief
    Baron of the Exchequer; then Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and
    died in 1676. The author of numerous works, not only on professional
    subjects, but on mathematics and philosophy.]

1st June, 1671. An installation at Windsor.

6th June, 1671. I went to Council, where was produced a most exact and
ample information of the state of Jamaica, and of the best expedients as
to New England, on which there was a long debate; but at length it was
concluded that, if any, it should be only a conciliating paper at first,
or civil letter, till we had better information of the present face of
things, since we understood they were a people almost upon the very
brink of renouncing any dependence on the Crown.

19th June, 1671. To a splendid dinner at the great room in Deptford
Trinity House, Sir Thomas Allen chosen Master, and succeeding the Earl
of Craven.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1671. To carry Colonel Middleton to Whitehall, to my Lord
Sandwich, our President, for some information which he was able to give
of the state of the Colony in New England.

21st June, 1671. To Council again, when one Colonel Cartwright, a
Nottinghamshire man, (formerly in commission with Colonel Nicholls) gave
us a considerable relation of that country; on which the Council
concluded that in the first place a letter of amnesty should be
dispatched.

24th June, 1671. Constantine Huygens, Signor of Zuylichem, that
excellent learned man, poet, and musician, now near eighty years of age,
a vigorous, brisk man,[28] came to take leave of me before his return
into Holland with the Prince, whose Secretary he was.

    [Footnote 28: He died in 1687, at the great age of 90 years and 6
    months. Constantine and his son, Christian Huygens, were both
    eminent for scientific knowledge and classical attainments;
    Christian, particularly so; for he was the inventor of the pendulum,
    made an improvement in the air-pump, first discovered the ring and
    one of the satellites of Saturn, and ascertained the laws of
    collision of elastic bodies. He died in 1695. Constantine, the
    father, was a person of influence and distinction in Holland, and
    held the post of secretary to the Prince of Orange.]

26th June, 1671. To Council, where Lord Arlington acquainted us that it
was his Majesty's proposal we should, every one of us, contribute £20
toward building a Council chamber and conveniences somewhere in
Whitehall, that his Majesty might come and sit among us, and hear our
debates; the money we laid out to be reimbursed out of the contingent
moneys already set apart for us, viz, £1,000 yearly. To this we
unanimously consented. There came an uncertain bruit from Barbadoes of
some disorder there. On my return home I stepped in at the theater to
see the new machines for the intended scenes, which were indeed very
costly and magnificent.

29th June, 1671. To Council, where were letters from Sir Thomas
Modiford, of the expedition and exploit of Colonel Morgan, and others of
Jamaica, on the Spanish Continent at Panama.

4th July, 1671. To Council, where we drew up and agreed to a letter to
be sent to New England, and made some proposal to Mr. Gorges, for his
interest in a plantation there.

24th July, 1671. To Council. Mr. Surveyor brought us a plot for the
building of our Council chamber, to be erected at the end of the Privy
garden, in Whitehall.

3d August, 1671. A full appearance at the Council. The matter in debate
was, whether we should send a deputy to New England, requiring them of
the Massachusetts to restore such to their limits and respective
possessions, as had petitioned the Council; this to be the open
commission only; but, in truth, with secret instructions to inform us of
the condition of those Colonies, and whether they were of such power, as
to be able to resist his Majesty and declare for themselves as
independent of the Crown, which we were told, and which of late years
made them refractory. Colonel Middleton, being called in, assured us
they might be curbed by a few of his Majesty's first-rate frigates, to
spoil their trade with the islands; but, though my Lord President was
not satisfied, the rest were, and we did resolve to advise his Majesty
to send Commissioners with a formal commission for adjusting boundaries,
etc., with some other instructions.

19th August, 1671. To Council. The letters of Sir Thomas Modiford were
read, giving relation of the exploit at Panama, which was very brave;
they took, burned, and pillaged the town of vast treasures, but the best
of the booty had been shipped off, and lay at anchor in the South Sea,
so that, after our men had ranged the country sixty miles about, they
went back to Nombre de Dios, and embarked for Jamaica. Such an action
had not been done since the famous Drake.

I dined at the Hamburg Resident's, and, after dinner, went to the
christening of Sir Samuel Tuke's son, Charles, at Somerset House, by a
Popish priest, and many odd ceremonies. The godfathers were the King,
and Lord Arundel of Wardour, and godmother, the Countess of Huntingdon.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th August, 1671. To London, with some more papers of my progress in
the Dutch War, delivered to the Treasurer.

1st September, 1671. Dined with the Treasurer, in company with my Lord
Arlington, Halifax, and Sir Thomas Strickland; and next day, went home,
being the anniversary of the late dreadful fire of London.

13th September, 1671. This night fell a dreadful tempest.

15th September, 1671. In the afternoon at Council, where letters were
read from Sir Charles Wheeler, concerning his resigning his government
of St. Christopher's.

21st September, 1671. I dined in the city, at the fraternity feast in
Ironmongers' Hall, where the four stewards chose their successors for
the next year, with a solemn procession, garlands about their heads, and
music playing before them; so, coming up to the upper tables where the
gentlemen sat, they drank to the new stewards; and so we parted.

22d September, 1671. I dined at the Treasurer's, where I had discourse
with Sir Henry Jones (now come over to raise a regiment of horse),
concerning the French conquests in Lorraine; he told me the King sold
all things to the soldiers, even to a handful of hay.

Lord Sunderland was now nominated Ambassador to Spain.

After dinner, the Treasurer carried me to Lincoln's Inn, to one of the
Parliament Clerks, to obtain of him, that I might carry home and peruse,
some of the Journals, which were, accordingly, delivered to me to
examine about the late Dutch War. Returning home, I went on shore to see
the Custom House, now newly rebuilt since the dreadful conflagration.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th and 10th October, 1671. I went, after evening service, to London,
in order to a journey of refreshment with Mr. Treasurer, to Newmarket,
where the King then was, in his coach with six brave horses, which we
changed thrice, first, at Bishop-Stortford, and last, at Chesterford;
so, by night, we got to Newmarket, where Mr. Henry Jermain (nephew to
the Earl of St. Alban) lodged me very civilly. We proceeded immediately
to Court, the King and all the English gallants being there at their
autumnal sports. Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's; and, the next day,
after dinner, I was on the heath, where I saw the great match run
between Woodcock and Flatfoot, belonging to the King, and to Mr. Eliot,
of the bedchamber, many thousands being spectators; a more signal race
had not been run for many years.

This over, I went that night with Mr. Treasurer to Euston, a palace of
Lord Arlington's, where we found Monsieur Colbert (the French
Ambassador), and the famous new French Maid of Honor, Mademoiselle
Querouaille, now coming to be in great favor with the King. Here was
also the Countess of Sunderland, and several lords and ladies, who
lodged in the house.

During my stay here with Lord Arlington, near a fortnight, his Majesty
came almost every second day with the Duke, who commonly returned to
Newmarket, but the King often lay here, during which time I had twice
the honor to sit at dinner with him, with all freedom. It was
universally reported that the fair lady ----, was bedded one of these
nights, and the stocking flung, after the manner of a married bride; I
acknowledge she was for the most part in her undress all day, and that
there was fondness and toying with that young wanton; nay, it was said,
I was at the former ceremony; but it is utterly false; I neither saw nor
heard of any such thing while I was there, though I had been in her
chamber, and all over that apartment late enough, and was myself
observing all passages with much curiosity. However, it was with
confidence believed she was first made _a Miss_, as they called these
unhappy creatures, with solemnity at this time.

On Sunday, a young Cambridge divine preached an excellent sermon in the
chapel, the King and the Duke of York being present.

16th October, 1671. Came all the great men from Newmarket, and other
parts both of Suffolk and Norfolk, to make their court, the whole house
filled from one end to the other with lords, ladies, and gallants; there
was such a furnished table, as I had seldom seen, nor anything more
splendid and free, so that for fifteen days there were entertained at
least 200 people, and half as many horses, besides servants and guards,
at infinite expense.

In the morning, we went hunting and hawking; in the afternoon, till
almost morning, to cards and dice, yet I must say without noise,
swearing, quarrel, or confusion of any sort. I, who was no gamester, had
often discourse with the French Ambassador, Colbert, and went sometimes
abroad on horseback with the ladies to take the air, and now and then to
hunting; thus idly passing the time, but not without more often recess
to my pretty apartment, where I was quite out of all this hurry, and had
leisure when I would, to converse with books, for there is no man more
hospitably easy to be withal than my Lord Arlington, of whose particular
friendship and kindness I had ever a more than ordinary share. His house
is a very noble pile, consisting of four pavilions after the French,
beside a body of a large house, and, though not built altogether, but
formed of additions to an old house (purchased by his Lordship of one
Sir T. Rookwood) yet with a vast expense made not only capable and
roomsome, but very magnificent and commodious, as well within as
without, nor less splendidly furnished. The staircase is very elegant,
the garden handsome, the canal beautiful, but the soil dry, barren, and
miserably sandy, which flies in drifts as the wind sits. Here my Lord
was pleased to advise with me about ordering his plantations of firs,
elms, limes, etc., up his park, and in all other places and avenues. I
persuaded him to bring his park so near as to comprehend his house
within it; which he resolved upon, it being now near a mile to it. The
water furnishing the fountains, is raised by a pretty engine, or very
slight plain wheels, which likewise serve to grind his corn, from a
small cascade of the canal, the invention of Sir Samuel Morland. In my
Lord's house, and especially above the staircase, in the great hall and
some of the chambers and rooms of state, are paintings in fresco by
Signor Verrio, being the first work which he did in England.

[Sidenote: NORWICH]

17th October, 1671. My Lord Henry Howard coming this night to visit my
Lord Chamberlain, and staying a day, would needs have me go with him to
Norwich, promising to convey me back, after a day or two; this, as I
could not refuse, I was not hard to be pursuaded to, having a desire to
see that famous scholar and physician, Dr. T. Browne, author of the
"_Religio Medici_" and "Vulgar Errors," now lately knighted. Thither,
then, went my Lord and I alone, in his flying chariot with six horses;
and by the way, discoursing with me of several of his concerns, he
acquainted me of his going to marry his eldest son to one of the King's
natural daughters, by the Duchess of Cleveland; by which he reckoned he
should come into mighty favor. He also told me that, though he kept that
idle creature, Mrs. B----, and would leave £200 a year to the son he had
by her, he would never marry her, and that the King himself had
cautioned him against it. All the world knows how he kept his promise,
and I was sorry at heart to hear what now he confessed to me; and that a
person and a family which I so much honored for the sake of that noble
and illustrious friend of mine, his grandfather, should dishonor and
pollute them both with those base and vicious courses he of late had
taken since the death of Sir Samuel Tuke, and that of his own virtuous
lady (my Lady Anne Somerset, sister to the Marquis); who, while they
lived, preserved this gentleman by their example and advice from those
many extravagances that impaired both his fortune and reputation.

Being come to the Ducal palace, my Lord made very much of me; but I had
little rest, so exceedingly desirous he was to show me the contrivance
he had made for the entertainment of their Majesties, and the whole
Court not long before, and which, though much of it was but temporary,
apparently framed of boards only, was yet standing. As to the palace, it
is an old wretched building, and that part of it newly built of brick,
is very ill understood; so as I was of the opinion it had been much
better to have demolished all, and set it up in a better place, than to
proceed any further; for it stands in the very market-place, and, though
near a river, yet a very narrow muddy one, without any extent.

Next morning, I went to see Sir Thomas Browne (with whom I had some
time corresponded by letter, though I had never seen him before); his
whole house and garden being a paradise and cabinet of rarities; and
that of the best collection, especially medals, books, plants, and
natural things. Among other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a collection of
the eggs of all the fowl and birds he could procure, that country
(especially the promontory of Norfolk) being frequented, as he said, by
several kinds which seldom or never go further into the land, as cranes,
storks, eagles, and variety of water fowl. He led me to see all the
remarkable places of this ancient city, being one of the largest, and
certainly, after London, one of the noblest of England, for its
venerable cathedral, number of stately churches, cleanness of the
streets, and buildings of flint so exquisitely headed and squared, as I
was much astonished at; but he told me they had lost the art of squaring
the flints, in which they so much excelled, and of which the churches,
best houses, and walls, are built. The Castle is an antique extent of
ground, which now they call Marsfield, and would have been a fitting
area to have placed the Ducal palace in. The suburbs are large, the
prospects sweet, with other amenities, not omitting the flower gardens,
in which all the inhabitants excel. The fabric of stuffs brings a vast
trade to this populous town.

Being returned to my Lord's, who had been with me all this morning, he
advised with me concerning a plot to rebuild his house, having already,
as he said, erected a front next the street, and a left wing, and now
resolving to set up another wing and pavilion next the garden, and to
convert the bowling green into stables. My advice was, to desist from
all, and to meditate wholly on rebuilding a handsome palace at Arundel
House, in the Strand, before he proceeded further here, and then to
place this in the Castle, that ground belonging to his Lordship.

I observed that most of the church yards (though some of them large
enough) were filled up with earth, or rather the congestion of dead
bodies one upon another, for want of earth, even to the very top of the
walls, and some above the walls, so as the churches seemed to be built
in pits.

18th October, 1671. I returned to Euston, in Lord Henry Howard's coach,
leaving him at Norwich, in company with a very ingenious gentleman, Mr.
White, whose father and mother (daughter to the late Lord Treasurer
Weston, Earl of Portland) I knew at Rome, where this gentleman was born,
and where his parents lived and died with much reputation, during their
banishment in our civil broils.

21st October, 1671. Quitting Euston, I lodged this night at Newmarket,
where I found the jolly blades racing, dancing, feasting, and reveling;
more resembling a luxurious and abandoned rout, than a Christian Court.
The Duke of Buckingham was now in mighty favor, and had with him that
impudent woman, the Countess of Shrewsbury, with his band of fiddlers,
etc.

Next morning, in company with Sir Bernard Gascoyne, and Lord Hawley, I
came in the Treasurer's coach to Bishop Stortford, where he gave us a
noble supper. The following day, to London, and so home.

14th November, 1671. To Council, where Sir Charles Wheeler, late
Governor of the Leeward Islands, having been complained of for many
indiscreet managements, it was resolved, on scanning many of the
particulars, to advise his Majesty to remove him; and consult what was
to be done, to prevent these inconveniences he had brought things to.
This business staid me in London almost a week, being in Council, or
Committee, every morning till the 25th.

27th November, 1671. We ordered that a proclamation should be presented
to his Majesty to sign, against what Sir Charles Wheeler had done in St.
Christopher's since the war, on the articles of peace at Breda. He was
shortly afterward recalled.

6th December, 1671. Came to visit me Sir William Haywood, a great
pretender to English antiquities.

14th December, 1671. Went to see the Duke of Buckingham's ridiculous
farce and rhapsody, called the "The Recital,"[29] buffooning all plays,
yet profane enough.

    [Footnote 29: The well-known play of "The Rehearsal" is meant.]

23d December, 1671. The Councillors of the Board of Trade dined together
at the Cock, in Suffolk street.

12th January, 1671-72. His Majesty renewed us our lease of Sayes Court
pastures for ninety-nine years, but ought, according to his solemn
promise[30] (as I hope he will still perform), have passed them to us in
fee-farm.

    [Footnote 30: The King's engagement, under his hand, is now at
    Wotton.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d January, 1672. To London, in order to Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, resigning his place as Clerk of the Council to Joseph
Williamson, Esq., who was admitted, and was knighted. This place his
Majesty had promised to give me many years before; but, upon
consideration of the renewal of our lease and other reasons, I chose to
part with it to Sir Joseph, who gave us and the rest of his brother
clerks a handsome supper at his house; and, after supper, a concert of
music.

3d February, 1672. An extraordinary snow; part of the week was taken up
in consulting about the commission of prisoners of war, and instructions
to our officers, in order to a second war with the Hollanders, his
Majesty having made choice of the former commissioners, and myself among
them.

11th February, 1672. In the afternoon, that famous proselyte, Monsieur
Brevall, preached at the Abbey, in English, extremely well and with much
eloquence. He had been a Capuchin, but much better learned than most of
that order.

12th February, 1672. At the Council, we entered on inquiries about
improving the plantations by silks, galls, flax, senna, etc., and
considered how nutmegs and cinnamon might be obtained and brought to
Jamaica, that soil and climate promising success. Dr. Worsley being
called in, spoke many considerable things to encourage it. We took order
to send to the plantations, that none of their ships should adventure
homeward single, but stay for company and convoys. We also deliberated
on some fit person to go as commissioner to inspect their actions in New
England, and, from time to time, report how that people stood affected.
In future, to meet at Whitehall.

20th February, 1672. Dr. Parr, of Camberwell, preached a most pathetic
funeral discourse and panegyric at the interment of our late pastor, Dr.
Breton (who died on the 18th), on "Happy is the servant whom, when his
Lord cometh," etc. This good man, among other expressions, professed
that he had never been so touched and concerned at any loss as at this,
unless at that of King Charles our martyr, and Archbishop Usher, whose
chaplain he had been. Dr. Breton had preached on the 28th and 30th of
January: on the Friday, having fasted all day, making his provisionary
sermon for the Sunday following, he went well to bed; but was taken
suddenly ill and expired before help could come to him.

Never had a parish a greater loss, not only as he was an excellent
preacher, and fitted for our great and vulgar auditory, but for his
excellent life and charity, his meekness and obliging nature,
industrious, helpful, and full of good works. He left near £400 to the
poor in his will, and that what children of his should die in their
minority, their portion should be so employed, I lost in particular a
special friend, and one that had an extraordinary love for me and mine.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th February, 1672. To London, to speak with the Bishop, and Sir John
Cutler, our patron, to present Mr. Frampton (afterward Bishop of
Gloucester).

1st March, 1672. A full Council of Plantations, on the danger of the
Leeward Islands, threatened by the French, who had taken some of our
ships, and began to interrupt our trade. Also in debate, whether the new
Governor of St. Christopher should be subordinate to the Governor of
Barbadoes. The debate was serious and long.

12th March, 1672. Now was the first blow given by us to the Dutch convoy
of the Smyrna fleet, by Sir Robert Holmes and Lord Ossory, in which we
received little save blows, and a worthy reproach for attacking our
neighbors ere any war was proclaimed, and then pretending the occasion
to be, that some time before, the Merlin yacht chancing to sail through
the whole Dutch fleet, their Admiral did not strike to that trifling
vessel. Surely, this was a quarrel slenderly grounded, and not becoming
Christian neighbors. We are likely to thrive, accordingly. Lord Ossory
several times deplored to me his being engaged in it; he had more
justice and honor than in the least to approve of it, though he had been
over-persuaded to the expedition. There is no doubt but we should have
surprised this exceeding rich fleet, had not the avarice and ambition of
Holmes and Spragge separated themselves, and willfully divided our
fleet, on presumption that either of them was strong enough to deal with
the Dutch convoy without joining and mutual help; but they so warmly
plied our divided fleets, that while in conflict the merchants sailed
away, and got safe into Holland.

A few days before this, the Treasurer of the Household, Sir Thomas
Clifford, hinted to me, as a confidant, that his Majesty would SHUT UP
THE EXCHEQUER (and, accordingly, his Majesty made use of infinite
treasure there, to prepare for an intended rupture); but, says he, it
will soon be open again, and everybody satisfied; for this bold man, who
had been the sole adviser of the King to invade that sacred stock
(though some pretend it was Lord Ashley's counsel, then Chancellor of
the Exchequer), was so over-confident of the success of this unworthy
design against the Smyrna merchants, as to put his Majesty on an action
which not only lost the hearts of his subjects, and ruined many widows
and orphans, whose stocks were lent him, but the reputation of his
Exchequer forever, it being before in such credit, that he might have
commanded half the wealth of the nation.

The credit of this bank being thus broken, did exceedingly discontent
the people, and never did his Majesty's affairs prosper to any purpose
after it, for as it did not supply the expense of the meditated war, so
it melted away, I know not how.

To this succeeded the King's declaration for an universal toleration;
Papists and swarms of Sectaries, now boldly showing themselves in their
public meetings. This was imputed to the same council, Clifford warping
to Rome as was believed, nor was Lord Arlington clear of suspicion, to
gratify that party, but as since it has proved, and was then evidently
foreseen, to the extreme weakening of the Church of England and its
Episcopal Government, as it was projected. I speak not this as my own
sense, but what was the discourse and thoughts of others, who were
lookers-on; for I think there might be some relaxations without the
least prejudice to the present establishment, discreetly limited, but to
let go the reins in this manner, and then to imagine they could take
them up again as easily, was a false policy, and greatly destructive.
The truth is, our Bishops slipped the occasion; for, had they held a
steady hand upon his Majesty's restoration, as they might easily have
done, the Church of England had emerged and flourished, without
interruption; but they were then remiss, and covetous after advantages
of another kind while his Majesty suffered them to come into a harvest,
with which, without any injustice he might have remunerated innumerable
gallant gentlemen for their services who had ruined themselves in the
late rebellion.

21st March, 1672. I visited the coasts in my district of Kent, and
divers wounded and languishing poor men, that had been in the Smyrna
conflict. I went over to see the new-begun Fort of Tilbury; a royal
work, indeed, and such as will one day bridle a great city to the
purpose, before they are aware.

23d March, 1672. Captain Cox, one of the Commissioners of the Navy,
furnishing me with a yatch, I sailed to Sheerness to see that fort also,
now newly finished; several places on both sides the Swale and Medway to
Gillingham and Upnore, being also provided with redoubts and batteries
to secure the station of our men-of-war at Chatham, and shut the door
when the steeds were stolen.

24th March, 1672. I saw the chirurgeon cut off the leg of a wounded
sailor, the stout and gallant man enduring it with incredible patience,
without being bound to his chair, as usual on such painful occasions. I
had hardly courage enough to be present. Not being cut off high enough
the gangrene prevailed, and the second operation cost the poor creature
his life.

Lord! what miseries are mortal men subject to, and what confusion and
mischief do the avarice, anger, and ambition of Princes, cause in the
world!

25th March, 1672. I proceeded to Canterbury, Dover, Deal, the Isle of
Thanet, by Sandwich, and so to Margate. Here we had abundance of
miserably wounded men, his Majesty sending his chief chirurgeon,
Sergeant Knight, to meet me, and Dr. Waldrond had attended me all the
journey. Having taken order for the accommodation of the wounded, I came
back through a country the best cultivated of any that in my life I had
anywhere seen, every field lying as even as a bowling-green, and the
fences, plantations, and husbandry, in such admirable order, as
infinitely delighted me, after the sad and afflicting spectacles and
objects I was come from. Observing almost every tall tree to have a
weathercock on the top bough, and some trees half-a-dozen, I learned
that, on a certain holyday, the farmers feast their servants; at which
solemnity, they set up these cocks, in a kind of triumph.

[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

Being come back toward Rochester, I went to take order respecting the
building a strong and high wall about a house I had hired of a
gentleman, at a place called Hartlip, for a prison, paying £50 yearly
rent. Here I settled a Provost-Marshal and other officers, returning by
Feversham. On the 30th heard a sermon in Rochester cathedral, and so got
to Sayes Court on the first of April.

4th April, 1672. I went to see the fopperies of the Papists at
Somerset-House and York-House, where now the French Ambassador had
caused to be represented our Blessed Savior at the Pascal Supper with
his disciples, in figures and puppets made as big as the life, of
wax-work, curiously clad and sitting round a large table, the room nobly
hung, and shining with innumerable lamps and candles: this was exposed
to all the world; all the city came to see it. Such liberty had the
Roman Catholics at this time obtained.

16th April, 1672. Sat in Council, preparing Lord Willoughby's commission
and instructions as Governor of Barbadoes and the Caribbee Islands.

17th April, 1672. Sat on business in the Star Chamber.

19th April, 1672. At Council, preparing instructions for Colonel
Stapleton, now to go Governor of St. Christopher's, and heard the
complaints of the Jamaica merchants against the Spaniards, for hindering
them from cutting logwood on the mainland, where they have no pretense.

21st April, 1672. To my Lord of Canterbury, to entreat him to engage Sir
John Cutler, the patron, to provide us a grave and learned man, in
opposition to a novice.

30th April, 1672. Congratulated Mr. Treasurer Clifford's new honor,
being made a Baron.

2d May, 1672. My son, John, was specially admitted of the Middle Temple
by Sir Francis North, his Majesty's Solicitor-General, and since
Chancellor. I pray God bless this beginning, my intention being that he
should seriously apply himself to the study of the law.

10th May, 1672. I was ordered, by letter from the Council, to repair
forthwith to his Majesty, whom I found in the Pall-Mall, in St. James's
Park, where his Majesty coming to me from the company, commanded me to
go immediately to the seacoast, and to observe the motion of the Dutch
fleet and ours, the Duke and so many of the flower of our nation being
now under sail, coming from Portsmouth, through the Downs, where it was
believed there might be an encounter.

11th May, 1672. Went to Chatham. 12th. Heard a sermon in Rochester
Cathedral.

13th May, 1672. To Canterbury; visited Dr. Bargrave, my old
fellow-traveler in Italy, and great virtuoso.

14th May, 1672. To Dover; but the fleet did not appear till the 16th,
when the Duke of York with his and the French squadron, in all 170 ships
(of which above 100 were men-of-war), sailed by, after the Dutch, who
were newly withdrawn. Such a gallant and formidable navy never, I think,
spread sail upon the seas. It was a goodly yet terrible sight, to behold
them as I did, passing eastward by the straits between Dover and Calais
in a glorious day. The wind was yet so high, that I could not well go
aboard, and they were soon got out of sight. The next day, having
visited our prisoners and the Castle, and saluted the Governor, I took
horse for Margate. Here, from the North Foreland Lighthouse top (which
is a pharos, built of brick, and having on the top a cradle of iron, in
which a man attends a great sea-coal fire all the year long, when the
nights are dark, for the safeguard of sailors), we could see our fleet
as they lay at anchor. The next morning, they weighed, and sailed out of
sight to the N. E.

[Sidenote: MARGATE]

19th May, 1672. Went to Margate; and, the following day, was carried to
see a gallant widow, brought up a farmeress, and I think of gigantic
race, rich, comely, and exceedingly industrious. She put me in mind of
Deborah and Abigail, her house was so plentifully stored with all manner
of country provisions, all of her own growth, and all her conveniences
so substantial, neat, and well understood; she herself so jolly and
hospitable; and her land so trim and rarely husbanded, that it struck me
with admiration at her economy.

This town much consists of brewers of a certain heady ale, and they deal
much in malt, etc. For the rest, it is raggedly built, and has an ill
haven, with a small fort of little concernment, nor is the island well
disciplined; but as to the husbandry and rural part, far exceeding any
part of England for the accurate culture of their ground, in which they
exceed, even to curiosity and emulation.

We passed by Rickborough, and in sight of Reculvers, and so through a
sweet garden, as it were, to Canterbury.

24th May, 1672. To London and gave his Majesty an account of my journey,
and that I had put all things in readiness upon all events, and so
returned home sufficiently wearied.

31st May, 1672. I received another command to repair to the seaside; so
I went to Rochester, where I found many wounded, sick, and prisoners,
newly put on shore after the engagement on the 28th, in which the Earl
of Sandwich, that incomparable person and my particular friend, and
divers more whom I loved, were lost. My Lord (who was Admiral of the
Blue) was in the "Prince," which was burnt, one of the best men-of-war
that ever spread canvas on the sea. There were lost with this brave man,
a son of Sir Charles Cotterell (Master of the Ceremonies), and a son of
Sir Charles Harbord (his Majesty's Surveyor-General), two valiant and
most accomplished youths, full of virtue and courage, who might have
saved themselves; but chose to perish with my Lord, whom they honored
and loved above their own lives.

Here, I cannot but make some reflections on things past. It was not
above a day or two that going to Whitehall to take leave of his
Lordship, who had his lodgings in the Privy-Garden, shaking me by the
hand he bid me good-by, and said he thought he would see me no more, and
I saw, to my thinking, something boding in his countenance: "No," says
he, "they will not have me live. Had I lost a fleet (meaning on his
return from Bergen when he took the East India prize) I should have
fared better; but, be as it pleases God--I must do something, I know not
what, to save my reputation." Something to this effect, he had hinted to
me; thus I took my leave. I well remember that the Duke of Albemarle,
and my now Lord Clifford, had, I know not why, no great opinion of his
courage, because, in former conflicts, being an able and experienced
seaman (which neither of them were), he always brought off his Majesty's
ships without loss, though not without as many marks of true courage as
the stoutest of them; and I am a witness that, in the late war, his own
ship was pierced like a colander. But the business was, he was utterly
against this war from the beginning, and abhorred the attacking of the
Smyrna fleet; he did not favor the heady expedition of Clifford at
Bergen, nor was he so furious and confident as was the Duke of
Albemarle, who believed he could vanquish the Hollanders with one
squadron. My Lord Sandwich was prudent as well as valiant, and always
governed his affairs with success and little loss; he was for
deliberation and reason, they for action and slaughter without either;
and for this, whispered as if my Lord Sandwich was not so gallant,
because he was not so rash, and knew how fatal it was to lose a fleet,
such as was that under his conduct, and for which these very persons
would have censured him on the other side. This it was, I am confident,
grieved him, and made him enter like a lion, and fight like one too, in
the midst of the hottest service, where the stoutest of the rest seeing
him engaged, and so many ships upon him, dared not, or would not, come
to his succor, as some of them, whom I know, might have done. Thus, this
gallant person perished, to gratify the pride and envy of some I named.

Deplorable was the loss of one of the best accomplished persons, not
only of this nation, but of any other. He was learned in sea affairs, in
politics, in mathematics, and in music: he had been on divers embassies,
was of a sweet and obliging temper, sober, chaste, very ingenious, a
true nobleman, an ornament to the Court and his Prince; nor has he left
any behind him who approach his many virtues.

He had, I confess, served the tyrant Cromwell, when a young man, but it
was without malice, as a soldier of fortune; and he readily submitted,
and that with joy, bringing an entire fleet with him from the Sound, at
the first tidings of his Majesty's restoration. I verily believe him as
faithful a subject as any that were not his friends. I am yet heartily
grieved at this mighty loss, nor do I call it to my thoughts without
emotion.

[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

2d June, 1672. Trinity Sunday, I passed at Rochester; and, on the 5th,
there was buried in the Cathedral Monsieur Rabiniére, Rear Admiral of
the French squadron, a gallant person, who died of the wounds he
received in the fight. This ceremony lay on me, which I performed with
all the decency I could, inviting the Mayor and Aldermen to come in
their formalities. Sir Jonas Atkins was there with his guards; and the
Dean and Prebendaries: one of his countrymen pronouncing a funeral
oration at the brink of his grave, which I caused to be dug in the
choir. This is more at large described in the "Gazette" of that day;
Colonel Reymes, my colleague in commission, assisting, who was so kind
as to accompany me from London, though it was not his district; for
indeed the stress of both these wars lay more on me by far than on any
of my brethren, who had little to do in theirs. I went to see Upnore
Castle, which I found pretty well defended, but of no great moment.

Next day I sailed to the fleet, now riding at the buoy of the "Nore,"
where I met his Majesty, the Duke, Lord Arlington, and all the great
men, in the "Charles," lying miserably shattered; but the miss of Lord
Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, and showed the folly of hazarding so
brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation but that
the Hollanders exceeded us in industry, and in all things but envy.

At Sheerness, I gave his Majesty and his Royal Highness an account of my
charge, and returned to Queenborough; next day dined at Major Dorel's,
Governor of Sheerness; thence, to Rochester; and the following day,
home.

12th June, 1672. To London to his Majesty, to solicit for money for the
sick and wounded, which he promised me.

19th June, 1672. To London again, to solicit the same.

21st June, 1672. At a Council of Plantations. Most of this week busied
with the sick and wounded.

3d July, 1672. To Lord Sandwich's funeral, which was by water to
Westminster, in solemn pomp.

31st July, 1672. I entertained the Maids of Honor (among whom there was
one I infinitely esteemed for her many and extraordinary virtues[31]) at
a comedy this afternoon, and so went home.

    [Footnote 31: Mrs. Blagg whom Evelyn never tires of instancing and
    characterizing as a rare example of piety and virtue, in so rare a
    wit, beauty, and perfection, in a licentious court, and depraved
    age. She was afterward married to Mr. Godolphin, and her life,
    written by Evelyn, has been edited and published by the Bishop of
    Oxford.]

1st August, 1672. I was at the betrothal of Lord Arlington's only
daughter (a sweet child if ever there was any[32]) to the Duke of
Grafton, the King's natural son by the Duchess of Cleveland; the
Archbishop of Canterbury officiating, the King and the grandees being
present. I had a favor given me by my Lady; but took no great joy at the
thing for many reasons.

    [Footnote 32: She was then only fifteen years old.]

18th August, 1672. Sir James Hayes, Secretary to Prince Rupert, dined
with me; after dinner I was sent to Gravesend to dispose of no fewer
than 800 sick men. That night I got to the fleet at the buoy of the
"Nore," where I spoke with the King and the Duke; and, after dinner next
day, returned to Gravesend.

1st September, 1672. I spent this week in soliciting for moneys, and in
reading to my Lord Clifford my papers relating to the first Holland war.
Now, our Council of Plantations met at Lord Shaftesbury's (Chancellor of
the Exchequer) to read and reform the draft of our new Patent, joining
the Council of Trade to our political capacities. After this, I returned
home, in order to another excursion to the seaside, to get as many as
possible of the men who were recovered on board the fleet.

8th September, 1672. I lay at Gravesend, thence to Rochester, returning
on the 11th.

15th September, 1672. Dr. Duport, Greek Professor of Cambridge, preached
before the King, on 1 Timothy vi. 6. No great preacher, but a very
worthy and learned man.

25th September, 1672. I dined at Lord John Berkeley's, newly arrived
out of Ireland, where he had been Deputy; it was in his new house, or
rather palace; for I am assured it stood him in near £30,000. It was
very well built, and has many noble rooms, but they are not very
convenient, consisting but of one _Corps de Logis_; they are all rooms
of state, without closets. The staircase is of cedar, the furniture is
princely: the kitchen and stables are ill placed, and the corridor
worse, having no report to the wings they join to. For the rest, the
fore-court is noble, so are the stables; and, above all, the gardens,
which are incomparable by reason of the inequality of the ground, and a
pretty piscina. The holly hedges on the terrace I advised the planting
of. The porticos are in imitation of a house described by Palladio; but
it happens to be the worst in his book, though my good friend, Mr. Hugh
May, his Lordship's architect, effected it.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th September, 1672. I carried with me to dinner my Lord H. Howard (now
to be made Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal of England) to Sir Robert
Clayton's, now Sheriff of London, at his new house, where we had a great
feast; it is built indeed for a great magistrate, at excessive cost. The
cedar dining room is painted with the history of the Giants' War,
incomparably done by Mr. Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye.

6th October, 1672. Dr. Thistlethwaite preached at Whitehall on Rev. v.
2,--a young, but good preacher. I received the blessed Communion, Dr.
Blandford, Bishop of Worcester, and Dean of the Chapel, officiating.
Dined at my Lord Clifford's, with Lord Mulgrave, Sir Gilbert Talbot, and
Sir Robert Holmes.

8th October, 1672. I took leave of my Lady Sunderland, who was going to
Paris to my Lord, now ambassador there. She made me stay to dinner at
Leicester House, and afterward sent for Richardson, the famous
fire-eater. He devoured brimstone on glowing coals before us, chewing
and swallowing them; he melted a beer-glass and ate it quite up; then,
taking a live coal on his tongue, he put on it a raw oyster, the coal
was blown on with bellows till it flamed and sparkled in his mouth, and
so remained till the oyster gaped and was quite boiled. Then, he melted
pitch and wax with sulphur, which he drank down as it flamed; I saw it
flaming in his mouth a good while; he also took up a thick piece of
iron, such as laundresses use to put in their smoothing boxes, when it
was fiery hot, held it between his teeth, then in his hand, and threw it
about like a stone; but this, I observed, he cared not to hold very
long; then he stood on a small pot, and, bending his body, took a
glowing iron with his mouth from between his feet, without touching the
pot, or ground, with his hands; with divers other prodigious feats.

13th October, 1672. After sermon (being summoned before), I went to my
Lord Keeper's, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at Essex House, where our new
patent was opened and read, constituting us that were of the Council of
Plantations, to be now of the Council of Trade also, both united. After
the patent was read, we all took our oaths, and departed.

24th October, 1672. Met in Council, the Earl of Shaftesbury, now our
president, swearing our secretary and his clerks, which was Mr. Locke,
an excellent learned gentleman, and student of Christ Church, Mr. Lloyd,
and Mr. Frowde. We dispatched a letter to Sir Thomas Linch, Governor of
Jamaica, giving him notice of a design of the Dutch on that island.

27th October, 1672. I went to hear that famous preacher, Dr. Frampton,
at St. Giles's, on Psalm xxxix. 6. This divine had been twice at
Jerusalem, and was not only a very pious and holy man, but excellent in
the pulpit for the moving affections.

8th November, 1672. At Council, we debated the business of the consulate
of Leghorn. I was of the committee with Sir Humphry Winch, the chairman,
to examine the laws of his Majesty's several plantations and colonies in
the West Indies, etc.

15th November, 1672. Many merchants were summoned about the consulate of
Venice; which caused great disputes; the most considerable thought it
useless. This being the Queen-Consort's birthday, there was an
extraordinary appearance of gallantry, and a ball danced at Court.

30th November, 1672. I was chosen secretary to the Royal Society.

21st December, 1672. Settled the consulate of Venice.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st January, 1672-73. After public prayers in the chapel at Whitehall,
when I gave God solemn thanks for all his mercies to me the year past,
and my humble supplications to him for his blessing the year now
entering, I returned home, having my poor deceased servant (Adams) to
bury, who died of pleurisy.

3d January, 1673. My son now published his version of "_Raptinus
Hortorum_."

28th January, 1673. Visited Don Francisco de Melos, the Portugal
Ambassador, who showed me his curious collection of books and pictures.
He was a person of good parts, and a virtuous man.

6th February, 1673. To Council about reforming an abuse of the dyers
with _saundus_, and other false drugs; examined divers of that trade.

23d February, 1673. The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King
on Coloss. ii. 14, 15, admirably well, as he can do nothing but what is
well.

5th March, 1673. Our new vicar, Mr. Holden, preached in Whitehall
chapel, on Psalm iv. 6, 7. This gentleman is a very excellent and
universal scholar, a good and wise man; but he had not the popular way
of preaching, nor is in any measure fit for our plain and vulgar
auditory, as his predecessor was. There was, however, no comparison
between their parts for profound learning. But time and experience may
form him to a more practical way than that he is in of University
lectures and erudition; which is now universally left off for what is
much more profitable.

15th March, 1673. I heard the speech made to the Lords in their House by
Sir Samuel Tuke, in behalf of the Papists, to take off the penal laws;
and then dined with Colonel Norwood.

16th March, 1673. Dr. Pearson, Bishop of Chester, preached on Hebrews
ix. 14; a most incomparable sermon from one of the most learned divines
of our nation. I dined at my Lord Arlington's with the Duke and Duchess
of Monmouth; she is one of the wisest and craftiest of her sex, and has
much wit. Here was also the learned Isaac Vossius.

During Lent there is constantly the most excellent preaching by the most
eminent bishops and divines of the nation.

26th March, 1673. I was sworn a younger brother of the Trinity House,
with my most worthy and long-acquainted noble friend, Lord Ossory
(eldest son to the Duke of Ormond), Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, being now Master of that Society; after which there was a
great collation.

29th March, 1673. I carried my son to the Bishop of Chichester, that
learned and pious man, Dr. Peter Gunning, to be instructed by him before
he received the Holy Sacrament, when he gave him most excellent advice,
which I pray God may influence and remain with him as long as he lives;
and O that I had been so blessed and instructed, when first I was
admitted to that sacred ordinance!

30th March, 1673. Easter day. Myself and son received the blessed
Communion, it being his first time, and with that whole week's more
extraordinary preparation. I beseech God to make him a sincere and good
Christian, while I endeavor to instill into him the fear and love of
God, and discharge the duty of a father.

At the sermon _coram Rege_, preached by Dr. Sparrow, Bishop of Exeter,
to a most crowded auditory; I stayed to see whether, according to
custom, the Duke of York received the Communion with the King; but he
did not, to the amazement of everybody. This being the second year he
had forborne, and put it off, and within a day of the Parliament
sitting, who had lately made so severe an Act against the increase of
Popery, gave exceeding grief and scandal to the whole nation, that the
heir of it, and the son of a martyr for the Protestant religion, should
apostatize. What the consequence of this will be, God only knows, and
wise men dread.

11th April, 1673. I dined with the plenipotentiaries designed for the
treaty of Nimeguen.

17th April, 1673. I carried Lady Tuke to thank the Countess of Arlington
for speaking to his Majesty in her behalf, for being one of the Queen
Consort's women. She carried us up into her new dressing room at Goring
House, where was a bed, two glasses, silver jars, and vases, cabinets,
and other so rich furniture as I had seldom seen; to this excess of
superfluity were we now arrived and that not only at Court, but almost
universally, even to wantonness and profusion.

Dr. Compton, brother to the Earl of Northampton, preached on 1 Corinth.
v. 11-16, showing the Church's power in ordaining things indifferent;
this worthy person's talent is not preaching, but he is likely to make a
grave and serious good man.

I saw her Majesty's rich toilet in her dressing room, being all of massy
gold, presented to her by the King, valued at £4,000.

26th April, 1673. Dr. Lamplugh preached at St. Martin's the Holy
Sacrament following, which I partook of, upon obligation of the late Act
of Parliament, enjoining everybody in office, civil or military, under
penalty of £500, to receive it within one month before two authentic
witnesses; being engrossed on parchment, to be afterward produced in the
Court of Chancery, or some other Court of Record; which I did at the
Chancery bar, as being one of the Council of Plantations and Trade;
taking then also the oath of allegiance and supremacy, signing the
clause in the said Act against Transubstantiation.

25th May, 1673. My son was made a younger brother of the Trinity House.
The new master was Sir J. Smith, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, a
stout seaman, who had interposed and saved the Duke from perishing by a
fire ship in the late war.

28th May, 1673. I carried one Withers, an ingenious shipwright, to the
King to show him some new method of building.

29th May, 1673. I saw the Italian comedy at the Court, this afternoon.

10th June, 1673. Came to visit and dine with me my Lord Viscount
Cornbury and his Lady; Lady Frances Hyde, sister to the Duchess of York;
and Mrs. Dorothy Howard, maid of Honor. We went, after dinner, to see
the formal and formidable camp on Blackheath, raised to invade Holland;
or, as others suspected for another design. Thence, to the Italian
glass-house at Greenwich, where glass was blown of finer metal than that
of Murano, at Venice.

13th June, 1673. Came to visit us, with other ladies of rank, Mrs.
Sedley,[33] daughter to Sir Charles, who was none of the most virtuous,
but a wit.

    [Footnote 33: The Duke of York's mistress, afterward created by him
    Countess of Dorchester.]

19th June, 1673. Congratulated the new Lord Treasurer, Sir Thomas
Osborne, a gentleman with whom I had been intimately acquainted at
Paris, and who was every day at my father-in-law's house and table
there; on which account I was too confident of succeeding in his favor,
as I had done in his predecessor's; but such a friend shall I never
find, and I neglected my time, far from believing that my Lord Clifford
would have so rashly laid down his staff, as he did, to the amazement of
all the world, when it came to the test of his receiving the Communion,
which I am confident he forbore more from some promise he had entered
into to gratify the Duke, than from any prejudice to the Protestant
religion, though I found him wavering a pretty while.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d June, 1673. To London, to accompany our Council who went in a body
to congratulate the new Lord Treasurer, no friend to it because promoted
by my Lord Arlington, whom he hated.

26th June, 1673. Came visitors from Court to dine with me and see the
army still remaining encamped on Blackheath.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th July, 1673. This evening I went to the funeral of my dear and
excellent friend, that good man and accomplished gentleman, Sir Robert
Murray, Secretary of Scotland. He was buried by order of his Majesty in
Westminster Abbey.

25th July, 1673. I went to Tunbridge Wells, to visit my Lord Clifford,
late Lord Treasurer, who was there to divert his mind more than his
body; it was believed that he had so engaged himself to the Duke, that
rather than take the Test, without which he was not capable of holding
any office, he would resign that great and honorable station. This, I am
confident, grieved him to the heart, and at last broke it; for, though
he carried with him music, and people to divert him, and, when I came to
see him, lodged me in his own apartment, and would not let me go from
him, I found he was struggling in his mind; and being of a rough and
ambitious nature, he could not long brook the necessity he had brought
on himself, of submission to this conjuncture. Besides, he saw the Dutch
war, which was made much by his advice, as well as the shutting up of
the Exchequer, very unprosperous. These things his high spirit could not
support. Having stayed here two or three days, I obtained leave of my
Lord to return.

In my way, I saw my Lord of Dorset's house at Knowle, near Sevenoaks, a
great old-fashioned house.

30th July, 1673. To Council, where the business of transporting wool was
brought before us.

31st July, 1673. I went to see the pictures of all the judges and
eminent men of the Long Robe, newly painted by Mr. Wright, and set up in
Guildhall, costing the city £1,000. Most of them are very like the
persons they represent, though I never took Wright to be any
considerable artist.

13th August, 1673. I rode to Durdans, where I dined at my Lord
Berkeley's of Berkeley Castle, my old and noble friend, it being his
wedding anniversary, where I found the Duchess of Albemarle, and other
company, and returned home on that evening late.

15th August, 1673. Came to visit me my Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
Shaftesbury.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th August, 1673. My Lord Clifford, being about this time returned
from Tunbridge, and preparing for Devonshire, I went to take my leave of
him at Wallingford House; he was packing up pictures, most of which were
of hunting wild beasts and vast pieces of bull-baiting, bear-baiting,
etc. I found him in his study, and restored to him several papers of
state, and others of importance, which he had furnished me with, on
engaging me to write the "History of the Holland War," with other
private letters of his acknowledgments to my Lord Arlington, who from a
private gentleman of a very noble family, but inconsiderable fortune,
had advanced him from almost nothing. The first thing was his being in
Parliament, then knighted, then made one of the Commissioners of sick
and wounded, on which occasion we sat long together; then, on the death
of Hugh Pollard, he was made Comptroller of the Household and Privy
Councillor, yet still my brother Commissioner; after the death of Lord
Fitz-Harding, Treasurer of the Household, he, by letters to Lord
Arlington, which that Lord showed me, begged of his Lordship to obtain
it for him as the very height of his ambition. These were written with
such submissions and professions of his patronage, as I had never seen
any more acknowledging. The Earl of Southampton then dying, he was made
one of the Commissioners of the Treasury. His Majesty inclining to put
it into one hand, my Lord Clifford, under pretense of making all his
interest for his patron, my Lord Arlington, cut the grass under his
feet, and procured it for himself, assuring the King that Lord Arlington
did not desire it. Indeed, my Lord Arlington protested to me that his
confidence in Lord Clifford made him so remiss and his affection to him
was so particular, that he was absolutely minded to devolve it on Lord
Clifford, all the world knowing how he himself affected ease and quiet,
now growing into years, yet little thinking of this go-by. This was the
great ingratitude Lord Clifford showed, keeping my Lord Arlington in
ignorance, continually assuring him he was pursuing his interest, which
was the Duke's into whose great favor Lord Clifford was now gotten; but
which certainly cost him the loss of all, namely, his going so
irrevocably far in his interest.

For the rest, my Lord Clifford was a valiant, incorrupt gentleman,
ambitious, not covetous; generous, passionate, a most constant, sincere
friend, to me in particular, so as when he laid down his office, I was
at the end of all my hopes and endeavors. These were not for high
matters, but to obtain what his Majesty was really indebted to my
father-in-law, which was the utmost of my ambition, and which I had
undoubtedly obtained, if this friend had stood. Sir Thomas Osborn, who
succeeded him, though much more obliged to my father-in-law and his
family, and my long and old acquaintance, being of a more haughty and
far less obliging nature, I could hope for little; a man of excellent
natural parts; but nothing of generous or grateful.

Taking leave of my Lord Clifford, he wrung me by the hand, and, looking
earnestly on me, bid me God-b'ye, adding, "Mr. Evelyn, I shall never see
thee more." "No!" said I, "my Lord, what's the meaning of this? I hope I
shall see you often, and as great a person again." "No, Mr. Evelyn, do
not expect it, I will never see this place, this city, or Court again,"
or words of this sound. In this manner, not without almost mutual tears,
I parted from him; nor was it long after, but the news was that he was
dead, and I have heard from some who I believe knew, he made himself
away, after an extraordinary melancholy. This is not confidently
affirmed, but a servant who lived in the house, and afterward with Sir
Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor, did, as well as others, report it, and when
I hinted some such thing to Mr. Prideaux, one of his trustees, he was
not willing to enter into that discourse.

It was reported with these particulars, that, causing his servant to
leave him unusually one morning, locking himself in, he strangled
himself with his cravat upon the bed-tester; his servant, not liking the
manner of dismissing him, and looking through the keyhole (as I
remember), and seeing his master hanging, broke in before he was quite
dead, and taking him down, vomiting a great deal of blood, he was heard
to utter these words: "Well; let men say what they will, there is a God,
a just God above"; after which he spoke no more. This, if true, is
dismal. Really, he was the chief occasion of the Dutch war, and of all
that blood which was lost at Bergen in attacking the Smyrna fleet, and
that whole quarrel.

This leads me to call to mind what my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury
affirmed, not to me only, but to all my brethren the Council of Foreign
Plantations, when not long after, this accident being mentioned as we
were one day sitting in Council, his Lordship told us this remarkable
passage: that, being one day discoursing with him when he was only Sir
Thomas Clifford, speaking of men's advancement to great charges in the
nation, "Well," says he, "my Lord, I shall be one of the greatest men in
England. Don't impute what I say either to fancy, or vanity; I am
certain that I shall be a mighty man; but it will not last long; I shall
not hold it, but die a bloody death." "What," says my Lord, "your
horoscope tells you so?" "No matter for that, it will be as I tell you."
"Well," says my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury, "if I were of that opinion,
I either would not be a great man, but decline preferment, or prevent my
danger."

This my Lord affirmed in my hearing before several gentlemen and
noblemen sitting in council at Whitehall. And I the rather am confident
of it, remembering what Sir Edward Walker (Garter King-at-Arms) had
likewise affirmed to me a long time before, even when he was first made
a Lord; that carrying his pedigree to Lord Clifford on his being created
a peer, and, finding him busy, he bade him go into his study and divert
himself there till he was at leisure to discourse with him about some
things relating to his family; there lay, said Sir Edward, on his table,
his horoscope and nativity calculated, with some writing under it, where
he read that he should be advanced to the highest degree in the state
that could be conferred upon him, but that he should not long enjoy it,
but should die, or expressions to that sense; and I think, (but cannot
confidently say) a bloody death. This Sir Edward affirmed both to me and
Sir Richard Browne; nor could I forbear to note this extraordinary
passage in these memoirs.

14th September, 1673. Dr. Creighton, son to the late eloquent Bishop of
Bath and Wells, preached to the Household on Isaiah, lvii. 8.

15th September, 1673. I procured £4,000 of the Lords of the Treasury,
and rectified divers matters about the sick and wounded.

16th September, 1673. To Council, about choosing a new Secretary.

17th September, 1673. I went with some friends to visit Mr. Bernard
Grenville, at Abs Court in Surrey; an old house in a pretty park.

23d September, 1673. I went to see Paradise, a room in Hatton Garden
furnished with a representation of all sorts of animals handsomely
painted on boards or cloth, and so cut out and made to stand, move, fly,
crawl, roar, and make their several cries. The man who showed it, made
us laugh heartily at his formal poetry.

15th October, 1673. To Council, and swore in Mr. Locke, secretary, Dr.
Worsley being dead.

27th October, 1673. To Council, about sending succors to recover New
York: and then we read the commission and instructions to Sir Jonathan
Atkins, the new Governor of Barbadoes.

5th November, 1673. This night the youths of the city burned the Pope in
effigy, after they had made procession with it in great triumph, they
being displeased at the Duke for altering his religion and marrying an
Italian lady.

30th November, 1673. On St. Andrew's day I first saw the new Duchess of
York, and the Duchess of Modena, her mother.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st December, 1673. To Gresham College, whither the city had invited the
Royal Society by many of their chief aldermen and magistrates, who gave
us a collation, to welcome us to our first place of assembly, from
whence we had been driven to give place to the City, on their making it
their Exchange on the dreadful conflagration, till their new Exchange
was finished, which it now was. The Society having till now been
entertained and having met at Arundel House.

2d December, 1673. I dined with some friends, and visited the sick;
thence, to an almshouse, where was prayers and relief, some very ill and
miserable. It was one of the best days I ever spent in my life.

3d December, 1673. There was at dinner my Lord Lockhart, designed
Ambassador for France, a gallant and sober person.

9th December, 1673. I saw again the Italian Duchess and her brother, the
Prince Reynaldo.

20th December, 1673. I had some discourse with certain strangers, not
unlearned, who had been born not far from Old Nineveh; they assured me
of the ruins being still extant, and vast and wonderful were the
buildings, vaults, pillars, and magnificent fragments;[34] but they
could say little of the Tower of Babel that satisfied me. But the
description of the amenity and fragrancy of the country for health and
cheerfulness, delighted me; so sensibly they spoke of the excellent air
and climate in respect of our cloudy and splenetic country.

    [Footnote 34: The remarkable discoveries of Mr. Layard give now a
    curious interest to this notice by Evelyn.]

24th December, 1673. Visited the prisoners at Ludgate, taking orders
about the releasing of some.

30th December, 1673. I gave Almighty God thanks for his infinite
goodness to me the year past, and begged his mercy and protection the
year following; afterward, invited my neighbors to spend the day with
me.

5th January, 1673-74. I saw an Italian opera in music, the first that
had been in England of this kind.

9th January, 1674. Sent for by his Majesty to write something against
the Hollanders about the duty of the Flag and Fishery. Returned with
some papers.

25th March, 1674. I dined at Knightsbridge, with the Bishops of
Salisbury, Chester, and Lincoln, my old friends.

29th May, 1674. His Majesty's birthday and Restoration. Mr. Demalhoy,
Roger L'Estrange, and several of my friends, came to dine with me on the
happy occasion.

27th June, 1674. Mr. Dryden, the famous poet and now laureate, came to
give me a visit. It was the anniversary of my marriage, and the first
day I went into my new little cell and cabinet, which I built below
toward the south court, at the east end of the parlor.

9th July, 1674. Paid £360 for purchase of Dr. Jacombe's son's share in
the mill and land at Deptford, which I bought of the Beechers.

22d July, 1674. I went to Windsor with my wife and son to see my
daughter Mary, who was there with my Lady Tuke and to do my duty to his
Majesty. Next day, to a great entertainment at Sir Robert Holmes's at
Cranbourne Lodge, in the Forest; there were his Majesty, the Queen,
Duke, Duchess, and all the Court. I returned in the evening with Sir
Joseph Williamson, now declared Secretary of State. He was son of a poor
clergyman somewhere in Cumberland, brought up at Queen's College,
Oxford, of which he came to be a fellow; then traveled with ... and
returning when the King was restored, was received as a clerk under Mr.
Secretary Nicholas. Sir Henry Bennett (now Lord Arlington) succeeding,
Williamson is transferred to him, who loving his ease more than business
(though sufficiently able had he applied himself to it) remitted all to
his man Williamson; and, in a short time, let him so into the secret of
affairs, that (as his Lordship himself told me) there was a kind of
necessity to advance him; and so, by his subtlety, dexterity, and
insinuation, he got now to be principal Secretary; absolutely Lord
Arlington's creature, and ungrateful enough. It has been the fate of
this obliging favorite to advance those who soon forgot their original.
Sir Joseph was a musician, could play at _Jeu de Goblets_, exceedingly
formal, a severe master to his servants, but so inward with my Lord
O'Brien, that after a few months of that gentleman's death, he married
his widow,[35] who, being sister and heir of the Duke of Richmond,
brought him a noble fortune. It was thought they lived not so kindly
after marriage as they did before. She was much censured for marrying so
meanly, being herself allied to the Royal family.

    [Footnote 35: Lady Catherine Stuart, sister and heir to Charles
    Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, the husband of Mrs. Frances
    Stuart, one of the most admired beauties of the Court, with whom
    Charles II. was so deeply in love that he never forgave the Duke for
    marrying her, having already, it is thought, formed some similar
    intention himself. He took the first opportunity of sending the Duke
    into an honorable exile, as Ambassador to Denmark, where he shortly
    after died, leaving no issue by the Duchess.]

[Sidenote: GROOMBRIDGE]

6th August, 1674. I went to Groombridge, to see my old friend, Mr.
Packer; the house built within a moat, in a woody valley. The old house
had been the place of confinement of the Duke of Orleans, taken by one
Waller (whose house it then was) at the battle of Agincourt, now
demolished, and a new one built in its place, though a far better
situation had been on the south of the wood, on a graceful ascent. At
some small distance, is a large chapel, not long since built by Mr.
Packer's father, on a vow he made to do it on the return of King Charles
I. out of Spain, 1625, and dedicated to St. Charles, but what saint
there was then of that name I am to seek, for, being a Protestant, I
conceive it was not Borromeo.

I went to see my farm at Ripe, near Lewes.

19th August, 1674. His Majesty told me how exceedingly the Dutch were
displeased at my treatise of the "History of Commerce;" that the Holland
Ambassador had complained to him of what I had touched of the Flags and
Fishery, etc., and desired the book might be called in; while on the
other side, he assured me he was exceedingly pleased with what I had
done, and gave me many thanks. However, it being just upon conclusion of
the treaty of Breda (indeed it was designed to have been published some
months before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty told me he must
recall it formally; but gave order that what copies should be publicly
seized to pacify the Ambassador, should immediately be restored to the
printer, and that neither he nor the vender should be molested. The
truth is, that which touched the Hollander was much less than what the
King himself furnished me with, and obliged me to publish, having caused
it to be read to him before it went to press; but the error was, it
should have been published before the peace was proclaimed. The noise of
this book's suppression made it presently to be bought up, and turned
much to the stationer's advantage. It was no other than the preface
prepared to be prefixed to my "History of the Whole War;" which I now
pursued no further.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st August, 1674. In one of the meadows at the foot of the long
Terrace below the Castle [Windsor], works were thrown up to show the
King a representation of the city of Maestricht, newly taken by the
French. Bastians, bulwarks, ramparts, palisadoes, graffs, horn-works,
counter-scarps, etc., were constructed. It was attacked by the Duke of
Monmouth (newly come from the real siege) and the Duke of York, with a
little army, to show their skill in tactics. On Saturday night they made
their approaches, opened trenches, raised batteries, took the
counter-scarp and ravelin, after a stout defense; great guns fired on
both sides, grenadoes shot, mines sprung, parties sent out, attempts of
raising the siege, prisoners taken, parleys; and, in short, all the
circumstances of a formal siege, to appearance, and, what is most
strange all without disorder, or ill accident, to the great satisfaction
of a thousand spectators. Being night, it made a formidable show. The
siege being over, I went with Mr. Pepys back to London, where we arrived
about three in the morning.

15th September, 1674. To Council, about fetching away the English left
at Surinam, etc., since our reconciliation with Holland.

21st September, 1674. I went to see the great loss that Lord Arlington
had sustained by fire at Goring House, this night consumed to the
ground, with exceeding loss of hangings, plate, rare pictures, and
cabinets; hardly anything was saved of the best and most princely
furniture that any subject had in England. My lord and lady were both
absent at the Bath.

6th October, 1674. The Lord Chief Baron Turner, and Sergeant Wild,
Recorder of London, came to visit me.

20th October, 1674. At Lord Berkeley's, I discoursed with Sir Thomas
Modiford, late Governor of Jamaica, and with Colonel Morgan, who
undertook that gallant exploit from Nombre de Dios to Panama, on the
Continent of America; he told me 10,000 men would easily conquer all the
Spanish Indies, they were so secure. They took great booty, and much
greater had been taken, had they not been betrayed and so discovered
before their approach, by which the Spaniards had time to carry their
vast treasure on board ships that put off to sea in sight of our men,
who had no boats to follow. They set fire to Panama, and ravaged the
country sixty miles about. The Spaniards were so supine and unexercised,
that they were afraid to fire a great gun.

31st October, 1674. My birthday, 54th year of my life. Blessed be God!
It was also preparation day for the Holy Sacrament, in which I
participated the next day, imploring God's protection for the year
following, and confirming my resolutions of a more holy life, even upon
the Holy Book. The Lord assist and be gracious unto me! Amen.

15th November, 1674. The anniversary of my baptism: I first heard that
famous and excellent preacher, Dr. Burnet, author of the "History of the
Reformation" on Colossians iii. 10, with such flow of eloquence and
fullness of matter, as showed him to be a person o£ extraordinary parts.

Being her Majesty's birthday, the Court was exceeding splendid in
clothes and jewels, to the height of excess.

17th November, 1674. To Council, on the business of Surinam, where the
Dutch had detained some English in prison, ever since the first war,
1665.

19th November, 1674. I heard that stupendous violin, Signor Nicholao
(with other rare musicians), whom I never heard mortal man exceed on
that instrument. He had a stroke so sweet, and made it speak like the
voice of a man, and, when he pleased, like a concert of several
instruments. He did wonders upon a note, and was an excellent composer.
Here was also that rare lutanist, Dr. Wallgrave; but nothing approached
the violin in Nicholao's hand. He played such ravishing things as
astonished us all.

2d December, 1674. At Mr. Slingsby's, master of the mint, my worthy
friend, a great lover of music. Heard Signor Francisco on the
harpsichord, esteemed one of the most excellent masters in Europe on
that instrument; then, came Nicholao with his violin, and struck all
mute, but Mrs. Knight, who sung incomparably, and doubtless has the
greatest reach of any English woman; she had been lately roaming in
Italy, and was much improved in that quality.

15th December, 1674. Saw a comedy at night, at Court, acted by the
ladies only, among them Lady Mary and Ann, his Royal Highness' two
daughters, and my dear friend Mrs. Blagg, who, having the principal
part, performed it to admiration. They were all covered with jewels.

22d December, 1674. Was at the repetition of the "Pastoral," on which
occasion Mrs. Blagg had about her near £20,000 worth of jewels, of which
she lost one worth about £80, borrowed of the Countess of Suffolk. The
press was so great, that it is a wonder she lost no more. The Duke made
it good.

20th January, 1674-75. Went to see Mr. Streeter, that excellent painter
of perspective and landscape, to comfort and encourage him to be cut for
the stone, with which that honest man was exceedingly afflicted.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d March, 1675. Supped at Sir William Petty's, with the Bishop of
Salisbury, and divers honorable persons. We had a noble entertainment in
a house gloriously furnished; the master and mistress of it were
extraordinary persons. Sir William was the son of a mean man somewhere
in Sussex, and sent from school to Oxford, where he studied Philosophy,
but was most eminent in Mathematics and Mechanics; proceeded Doctor of
Physic, and was grown famous, as for his learning so for his recovering
a poor wench that had been hanged for felony; and her body having been
begged (as the custom is) for the anatomy lecture, he bled her, put her
to bed to a warm woman, and, with spirits and other means, restored her
to life. The young scholars joined and made a little portion, and
married her to a man who had several children by her, she living fifteen
years after, as I have been assured. Sir William came from Oxford to be
tutor to a neighbor of mine; thence, when the rebels were dividing their
conquests in Ireland, he was employed by them to measure and set out the
land, which he did on an easy contract, so much per acre. This he
effected so exactly, that it not only furnished him with a great sum of
money; but enabled him to purchase an estate worth £4,000 a year. He
afterward married the daughter of Sir Hardress Waller; she was an
extraordinary wit as well as beauty, and a prudent woman.

Sir William, among other inventions, was author of the double-bottomed
ship, which perished, and he was censured for rashness, being lost in
the Bay of Biscay in a storm, when, I think, fifteen other vessels
miscarried. This vessel was flat-bottomed, of exceeding use to put into
shallow ports, and ride over small depths of water. It consisted of two
distinct keels cramped together with huge timbers, etc., so as that a
violent stream ran between; it bore a monstrous broad sail, and he still
persists that it is practicable, and of exceeding use; and he has often
told me he would adventure himself in such another, could he procure
sailors, and his Majesty's permission to make a second Experiment; which
name the King gave the vessel at the launching.

The Map of Ireland made by Sir William Petty is believed to be the most
exact that ever yet was made of any country. He did promise to publish
it; and I am told it has cost him near £1,000 to have it engraved at
Amsterdam. There is not a better Latin poet living, when he gives
himself that diversion; nor is his excellence less in Council and
prudent matters of state; but he is so exceedingly nice in sifting and
examining all possible contingencies, that he adventures at nothing
which is not demonstration. There was not in the whole world his equal
for a superintendent of manufacture and improvement of trade, or to
govern a plantation. If I were a Prince, I should make him my second
Counsellor, at least. There is nothing difficult to him. He is, besides,
courageous; on which account, I cannot but note a true story of him,
that when Sir Aleyn Brodrick sent him a challenge upon a difference
between them in Ireland, Sir William, though exceedingly purblind,
accepted the challenge, and it being his part to propound the weapon,
desired his antagonist to meet him with a hatchet, or axe, in a dark
cellar; which the other, of course, refused.

Sir William was, with all this, facetious and of easy conversation,
friendly and courteous, and had such a faculty of imitating others, that
he would take a text and preach, now like a grave orthodox divine, then
falling into the Presbyterian way, then to the fanatical, the Quaker,
the monk and friar, the Popish priest, with such admirable action, and
alteration of voice and tone, as it was not possible to abstain from
wonder, and one would swear to hear several persons, or forbear to think
he was not in good earnest an enthusiast and almost beside himself;
then, he would fall out of it into a serious discourse; but it was very
rarely he would be prevailed on to oblige the company with this faculty,
and that only among most intimate friends. My Lord Duke of Ormond once
obtained it of him, and was almost ravished with admiration; but by and
by, he fell upon a serious reprimand of the faults and miscarriages of
some Princes and Governors, which, though he named none, did so sensibly
touch the Duke, who was then Lieutenant of Ireland, that he began to be
very uneasy, and wished the spirit laid which he had raised, for he was
neither able to endure such truths, nor could he but be delighted. At
last, he melted his discourse to a ridiculous subject, and came down
from the joint stool on which he had stood; but my lord would not have
him preach any more. He never could get favor at Court, because he
outwitted all the projectors that came near him. Having never known such
another genius, I cannot but mention these particulars, among a
multitude of others which I could produce. When I, who knew him in mean
circumstances, have been in his splendid palace, he would himself be in
admiration how he arrived at it; nor was it his value or inclination for
splendid furniture and the curiosities of the age, but his elegant lady
could endure nothing mean, or that was not magnificent. He was very
negligent himself, and rather so of his person, and of a philosophic
temper. "What a to-do is here!" would he say, "I can lie in straw with
as much satisfaction."

He is author of the ingenious deductions from the bills of mortality,
which go under the name of Mr. Graunt; also of that useful discourse of
the manufacture of wool, and several others in the register of the Royal
Society. He was also author of that paraphrase on the 104th Psalm in
Latin verse, which goes about in MS., and is inimitable. In a word,
there is nothing impenetrable to him.

26th March, 1675. Dr. Brideoak was elected Bishop of Chichester, on the
translation of Dr. Gunning to Ely.

30th March, 1675. Dr. Allestree preached on Romans, vi. 3, the necessity
of those who are baptized to die to sin; a very excellent discourse from
an excellent preacher.

25th April, 1675. Dr. Barrow, that excellent, pious, and most learned
man, divine, mathematician, poet, traveler, and most humble person,
preached at Whitehall to the household, on Luke xx. 27, of love and
charity to our neighbors.

29th April, 1675. I read my first discourse, "Of Earth and Vegetation,"
before the Royal Society as a lecture in course, after Sir Robert
Southwell had read his, the week before, "On Water." I was commanded by
our President and the suffrage of the Society, to print it.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th May, 1675. This day was my dear friend, Mrs. Blagg, married at the
Temple Church to my friend, Mr. Sidney Godolphin, Groom of the
Bedchamber to his Majesty.

18th May, 1675. I went to visit one Mr. Bathurst, a Spanish merchant, my
neighbor.

31st May, 1675. I went with Lord Ossory to Deptford, where we chose him
Master of the Trinity Company.

2d June, 1675. I was at a conference of the Lords and Commons in the
Painted Chamber, on a difference about imprisoning some of their
members; and on the 3d, at another conference, when the Lords accused
the Commons for their transcendent misbehavior, breach of privilege,
Magna Charta, subversion of government, and other high, provoking, and
diminishing expressions, showing what duties and subjection they owed to
the Lords in Parliament, by record of Henry IV. This was likely to
create a notable disturbance.

15th June, 1675. This afternoon came Monsieur Querouaille and his lady,
parents to the famous beauty and ... favorite at Court, to see Sir R.
Browne, with whom they were intimately acquainted in Bretagne, at the
time Sir Richard was sent to Brest to supervise his Majesty's sea
affairs, during the latter part of the King's banishment. This
gentleman's house was not a mile from Brest; Sir Richard made an
acquaintance there, and, being used very civilly, was obliged to return
it here, which we did. He seemed a soldierly person and a good fellow,
as the Bretons generally are; his lady had been very handsome, and
seemed a shrewd understanding woman. Conversing with him in our garden,
I found several words of the Breton language the same with our Welsh.
His daughter was now made Duchess of Portsmouth, and in the height of
favor; but he never made any use of it.

27th June, 1675. At Ely House, I went to the consecration of my worthy
friend, the learned Dr. Barlow, Warden of Queen's College, Oxford, now
made Bishop of Lincoln. After it succeeded a magnificent feast, where
were the Duke of Ormond, Earl of Lauderdale, the Lord Treasurer, Lord
Keeper, etc.

8th July, 1675. I went with Mrs. Howard and her two daughters toward
Northampton Assizes, about a trial at law, in which I was concerned for
them as a trustee. We lay this night at Henley-on-the Thames, at our
attorney, Mr. Stephens's, who entertained us very handsomely. Next day,
dining at Shotover, at Sir Timothy Tyrill's, a sweet place, we lay at
Oxford, where it was the time of the Act. Mr. Robert Spencer, uncle to
the Earl of Sunderland, and my old acquaintance in France, entertained
us at his apartment in Christ Church with exceeding generosity.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th July, 1675. The Vice Chancellor Dr. Bathurst (who had formerly
taken particular care of my son), President of Trinity College invited
me to dinner, and did me great honor all the time of my stay. The next
day, he invited me and all my company, though strangers to him, to a
very noble feast. I was at all the academic exercises.--Sunday, at St.
Mary's, preached a Fellow of Brasen-nose, not a little magnifying the
dignity of Churchmen.

11th July, 1675. We heard the speeches, and saw the ceremony of creating
doctors in Divinity, Law and Physic. I had, early in the morning, heard
Dr. Morison, Botanic Professor, read on divers plants in the Physic
Garden; and saw that rare collection of natural curiosities of Dr.
Plot's, of Magdalen Hall, author of "The Natural History of
Oxfordshire," all of them collected in that shire, and indeed
extraordinary, that in one county there should be found such variety of
plants, shells, stones, minerals, marcasites, fowls, insects, models of
works, crystals, agates, and marbles. He was now intending to visit
Staffordshire, and, as he had of Oxfordshire, to give us the natural,
topical, political, and mechanical history. Pity it is that more of this
industrious man's genius were not employed so to describe every county
of England; it would be one of the most useful and illustrious works
that was ever produced in any age or nation.

I visited also the Bodleian Library and my old friend, the learned
Obadiah Walker, head of University College, which he had now almost
rebuilt, or repaired. We then proceeded to Northampton, where we arrived
the next day.

In this journey, went part of the way Mr. James Graham (since Privy
Purse to the Duke), a young gentleman exceedingly in love with Mrs.
Dorothy Howard, one of the maids of honor in our company. I could not
but pity them both, the mother not much favoring it. This lady was not
only a great beauty, but a most virtuous and excellent creature, and
worthy to have been wife to the best of men. My advice was required, and
I spoke to the advantage of the young gentleman, more out of pity than
that she deserved no better match; for, though he was a gentleman of
good family, yet there was great inequality.

14th July, 1675. I went to see my Lord Sunderland's Seat at Althorpe,
four miles from the ragged town of Northampton (since burned, and well
rebuilt). It is placed in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered and
flanked with stately woods and groves in a park, with a canal, but the
water is not running, which is a defect. The house, a kind of modern
building, of freestone, within most nobly furnished; the apartments very
commodious, a gallery and noble hall; but the kitchen being in the body
of the house, and chapel too small, were defects. There is an old yet
honorable gatehouse standing awry, and out-housing mean, but designed to
be taken away. It was moated round, after the old manner, but it is now
dry, and turfed with a beautiful carpet. Above all, are admirable and
magnificent the several ample gardens furnished with the choicest fruit,
and exquisitely kept. Great plenty of oranges, and other curiosities.
The park full of fowl, especially herons, and from it a prospect to
Holmby House, which being demolished in the late civil wars, shows like
a Roman ruin shaded by the trees about it, a stately, solemn, and
pleasing view.

15th July, 1675. Our cause was pleaded in behalf of the mother, Mrs.
Howard and her daughters, before Baron Thurland, who had formerly been
steward of Courts for me; we carried our cause, as there was reason, for
here was an impudent as well as disobedient son against his mother, by
instigation, doubtless, of his wife, one Mrs. Ogle (an ancient maid),
whom he had clandestinely married, and who brought him no fortune, he
being heir-apparent to the Earl of Berkshire. We lay at Brickhill, in
Bedfordshire, and came late the next day to our journey's end.

This was a journey of adventures and knight-errantry. One of the lady's
servants being as desperately in love with Mrs. Howard's woman, as Mr.
Graham was with her daughter, and she riding on horseback behind his
rival, the amorous and jealous youth having a little drink in his pate,
had here killed himself had he not been prevented; for, alighting from
his horse, and drawing his sword, he endeavored twice or thrice to fall
on it, but was interrupted by our coachman, and a stranger passing by.
After this, running to his rival, and snatching his sword from his side
(for we had beaten his own out of his hand), and on the sudden pulling
down his mistress, would have run both of them through; we parted them,
not without some blood. This miserable creature poisoned himself for her
not many days after they came to London.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th July, 1675. The Lord Treasurer's Chaplain preached at Wallingford
House.

9th August, 1675. Dr. Sprat, prebend of Westminster, and Chaplain to the
Duke of Buckingham, preached on the 3d Epistle of Jude, showing what the
primitive faith was, how near it and how excellent that of the Church of
England, also the danger of departing from it.

27th August, 1675. I visited the Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, and
dined at Sir Philip Warwick's, at Frogpoole [Frognall].

2d September, 1675. I went to see Dulwich College, being the pious
foundation of one Alleyn, a famous comedian, in King James's time. The
chapel is pretty, the rest of the hospital very ill contrived; it yet
maintains divers poor of both sexes. It is in a melancholy part of
Camberwell parish. I came back by certain medicinal Spa waters, at a
place called Sydenham Wells, in Lewisham parish, much frequented in
summer.

10th September, 1675. I was casually shown the Duchess of Portsmouth's
splendid apartment at Whitehall, luxuriously furnished, and with ten
times the richness and glory beyond the Queen's; such massy pieces of
plate, whole tables, and stands of incredible value.

29th September, 1675. I saw the Italian Scaramuccio act before the King
at Whitehall, people giving money to come in, which was very scandalous,
and never so before at Court diversions. Having seen him act before in
Italy, many years past, I was not averse from seeing the most excellent
of that kind of folly.

14th October, 1675. Dined at Kensington with my old acquaintance, Mr.
Henshaw, newly returned from Denmark, where he had been left resident
after the death of the Duke of Richmond, who died there Ambassador.

15th October, 1675. I got an extreme cold, such as was afterward so
epidemical, as not only to afflict us in this island, but was rife over
all Europe, like a plague. It was after an exceedingly dry summer and
autumn.

I settled affairs, my son being to go into France with my Lord Berkeley,
designed Ambassador-extraordinary for France and Plenipotentiary for the
general treaty of peace at Nimeguen.

24th October, 1675. Dined at Lord Chamberlain's with the Holland
Ambassador L. Duras, a valiant gentleman whom his Majesty made an
English Baron, of a cadet, and gave him his seat of Holmby, in
Northamptonshire.

27th October, 1675. Lord Berkeley coming into Council, fell down in the
gallery at Whitehall, in a fit of apoplexy, and being carried into my
Lord Chamberlain's lodgings, several famous doctors were employed all
that night, and with much ado he was at last recovered to some sense, by
applying hot fire pans and spirit of amber to his head; but nothing was
found so effectual as cupping him on the shoulders. It was almost a
miraculous restoration. The next day he was carried to Berkeley House.
This stopped his journey for the present, and caused my stay in town. He
had put all his affairs and his whole estate in England into my hands
during his intended absence, which though I was very unfit to undertake,
in regard of many businesses which then took me up, yet, upon the great
importunity of my lady and Mr. Godolphin (to whom I could refuse
nothing) I did take it on me. It seems when he was Deputy in Ireland,
not long before, he had been much wronged by one he left in trust with
his affairs, and therefore wished for some unmercenary friend who would
take that trouble on him; this was to receive his rents, look after his
houses and tenants, solicit supplies from the Lord Treasurer, and
correspond weekly with him, more than enough to employ any drudge in
England; but what will not friendship and love make one do?

31st October, 1675. Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, with my son. There
were the learned Isaac Vossius, and Spanhemius, son of the famous man of
Heidelberg; nor was this gentleman less learned, being a general
scholar. Among other pieces, he was author of an excellent treatise on
Medals.

10th November, 1675. Being the day appointed for my Lord Ambassador to
set out, I met them with my coach at New Cross. There were with him my
Lady his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs. Godolphin, who, out of an
extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany my lady to Paris, and
stay with her some time, which was the chief inducement for permitting
my son to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and in
regard my Lord himself had promised to take him into his special favor,
he having intrusted all he had to my care.

Thus we set out three coaches (besides mine), three wagons, and about
forty horses. It being late, and my Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got
but to Dartford, the first day, the next to Sittingbourne.

At Rochester, the major, Mr. Cony, then an officer of mine for the sick
and wounded of that place, gave the ladies a handsome refreshment as we
came by his house.

[Sidenote: DOVER]

12th November, 1675. We came to Canterbury: and, next morning, to Dover.

There was in my Lady Ambassadress's company my Lady Hamilton, a
sprightly young lady, much in the good graces of the family, wife of
that valiant and worthy gentleman, George Hamilton, not long after slain
in the wars. She had been a maid of honor to the Duchess, and now turned
Papist.

14th November, 1675. Being Sunday, my Lord having before delivered to me
his letter of attorney, keys, seal, and his Will, we took a solemn leave
of one another upon the beach, the coaches carrying them into the sea to
the boats, which delivered them to Captain Gunman's yacht, the "Mary."
Being under sail, the castle gave them seventeen guns, which Captain
Gunman answered with eleven. Hence, I went to church, to beg a blessing
on their voyage.

2d December, 1675. Being returned home, I visited Lady Mordaunt at
Parson's Green, my Lord, her son, being sick. This pious woman delivered
to me £100 to bestow as I thought fit for the release of poor prisoners,
and other charitable uses.

21st December, 1675. Visited her Ladyship again, where I found the
Bishop of Winchester, whom I had long known in France; he invited me to
his house at Chelsea.

23d December, 1675. Lady Sunderland gave me ten guineas, to bestow in
charities.

20th February, 1675-76. Dr. Gunning, Bishop of Ely, preached before the
King from St. John xx. 21, 22, 23, chiefly against an anonymous book,
called "Naked Truth," a famous and popular treatise against the
corruption in the Clergy, but not sound as to its quotations, supposed
to have been the Bishop of Hereford's and was answered by Dr. Turner, it
endeavoring to prove an equality of order of Bishop and Presbyter.

27th February, 1676. Dr. Pritchard, Bishop of Gloucester, preached at
Whitehall, on Isaiah v. 5, very allegorically, according to his manner,
yet very gravely and wittily.

29th February, 1676. I dined with Mr. Povey, one of the Masters of
Requests, a nice contriver of all elegancies, and exceedingly formal.
Supped with Sir J. Williamson, where were of our Society Mr. Robert
Boyle, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir William Petty, Dr. Holden, subdean of
his Majesty's Chapel, Sir James Shaen, Dr. Whistler, and our Secretary,
Mr. Oldenburg.

4th March, 1676. Sir Thomas Linch was returned from his government of
Jamaica.

16th March, 1676. The Countess of Sunderland and I went by water to
Parson's Green, to visit my Lady Mordaunt, and to consult with her about
my Lord's monument. We returned by coach.

19th March, 1676. Dr. Lloyd, late Curate of Deptford, but now Bishop of
Llandaff, preached before the King, on 1 Cor. xv. 57, that though sin
subjects us to death, yet through Christ we become his conquerors.

23d March, 1676. To Twickenham Park, Lord Berkeley's country seat, to
examine how the bailiffs and servants ordered matters.

24th March, 1676. Dr. Brideoake, Bishop of Chichester, preached a mean
discourse for a Bishop. I also heard Dr. Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester,
on Matt. xxvi. 38, of the sorrows of Christ, a deadly sorrow caused by
our sins; he was no great preacher.

30th March, 1676. Dining with my Lady Sunderland, I saw a fellow swallow
a knife, and divers great pebble stones, which would make a plain
rattling one against another. The knife was in a sheath of horn.

Dr. North, son of my Lord North, preached before the King, on Isaiah
liii. 57, a very young but learned and excellent person. Note. This was
the first time the Duke appeared no more in chapel, to the infinite
grief and threatened ruin of this poor nation.

2d April, 1676. I had now notice that my dear friend Mrs. Godolphin, was
returning from Paris. On the 6th, she arrived to my great joy, whom I
most heartily welcomed.

28th April, 1676. My wife entertained her Majesty at Deptford, for which
the Queen gave me thanks in the withdrawing room at Whitehall.

The University of Oxford presented me with the "_Marmora Oxoniensia
Arundeliana_"; the Bishop of Oxford writing to desire that I would
introduce Mr. Prideaux, the editor (a young man most learned in
antiquities) to the Duke of Norfolk, to present another dedicated to his
Grace, which I did, and we dined with the Duke at Arundel House, and
supped at the Bishop of Rochester's with Isaac Vossius.

7th May, 1676. I spoke to the Duke of York about my Lord Berkeley's
going to Nimeguen. Thence, to the Queen's Council at Somerset House,
about Mrs. Godolphin's lease of Spalding, in Lincolnshire.

11th May, 1676. I dined with Mr. Charleton, and went to see Mr.
Montague's new palace, near Bloomsbury, built by Mr. Hooke, of our
Society, after the French manner.[36]

    [Footnote 36: Now the British Museum.]

13th May, 1676. Returned home, and found my son returned from France;
praised be God!

22d May, 1676. Trinity Monday. A chaplain of my Lord Ossory's preached,
after which we took barge to Trinity House in London. Mr. Pepys
(Secretary of the Admiralty) succeeded my Lord as Master.

[Sidenote: ENFIELD]

2d June, 1676. I went with my Lord Chamberlain to see a garden, at
Enfield town; thence, to Mr. Secretary Coventry's lodge in the Chase. It
is a very pretty place, the house commodious, the gardens handsome, and
our entertainment very free, there being none but my Lord and myself.
That which I most wondered at was, that, in the compass of twenty-five
miles, yet within fourteen of London, there is not a house, barn,
church, or building, besides three lodges. To this Lodge are three great
ponds, and some few inclosures, the rest a solitary desert, yet stored
with no less than 3,000 deer. These are pretty retreats for gentlemen,
especially for those who are studious and lovers of privacy.

We returned in the evening by Hampstead, to see Lord Wotton's house and
garden (Bellsize House), built with vast expense by Mr. O'Neale, an
Irish gentleman who married Lord Wotton's mother, Lady Stanhope. The
furniture is very particular for Indian cabinets, porcelain, and other
solid and noble movables. The gallery very fine, the gardens very large,
but ill kept, yet woody and chargeable. The soil a cold weeping clay,
not answering the expense.

12th June, 1676. I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's new and fine house by
Peckham; it is on a flat, but has a fine garden and prospect through the
meadows to London.

2d July, 1676. Dr. Castillion, Prebend of Canterbury, preached before
the King, on John xv. 22, at Whitehall.

19th July, 1676. Went to the funeral of Sir William Sanderson, husband
to the Mother of the Maids, and author of two large but mean histories
of King James and King Charles I. He was buried at Westminster.

1st August, 1676. In the afternoon, after prayers at St. James's Chapel,
was christened a daughter of Dr. Leake's, the Duke's Chaplain:
godmothers were Lady Mary, daughter of the Duke of York, and the Duchess
of Monmouth: godfather, the Earl of Bath.

15th August, 1676. Came to dine with me my Lord Halifax, Sir Thomas
Meeres, one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty, Sir John Clayton, Mr.
Slingsby, Mr. Henshaw, and Mr. Bridgeman.

25th August, 1676. Dined with Sir John Banks at his house in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, on recommending Mr. Upman to be tutor to his son going into
France. This Sir John Banks was a merchant of small beginning, but had
amassed £100,000.

26th August, 1676. I dined at the Admiralty with Secretary Pepys, and
supped at the Lord Chamberlain's. Here was Captain Baker, who had been
lately on the attempt of the Northwest passage. He reported prodigious
depth of ice, blue as a sapphire, and as transparent. The thick mists
were their chief impediment, and cause of their return.

2d September, 1676. I paid £1,700 to the Marquis de Sissac, which he had
lent to my Lord Berkeley, and which I heard the Marquis lost at play in
a night or two.

The Dean of Chichester preached before the King, on Acts xxiv. 16; and
Dr. Crichton preached the second sermon before him on Psalm xc. 12, of
wisely numbering our days, and well employing our time.

3d September, 1676. Dined at Captain Graham's, where I became acquainted
with Dr. Compton (brother to the Earl of Northampton), now Bishop of
London, and Mr. North, son to the Lord North, brother to the Lord
Chief-Justice and Clerk of the Closet, a most hopeful young man. The
Bishop had once been a soldier, had also traveled in Italy, and became a
most sober, grave, and excellent prelate.

6th September, 1676. Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's, where also supped
the famous beauty and errant lady, the Duchess of Mazarine (all the
world knows her story), the Duke of Monmouth, Countess of Sussex (both
natural children of the King by the Duchess of Cleveland[37]), and the
Countess of Derby, a virtuous lady, daughter to my best friend, the Earl
of Ossory.

    [Footnote 37: Evelyn makes a slip here. The Duke of Monmouth's
    mother was, it is well known, Lucy Walters, sometimes called Mrs.
    Barlow, and heretofore mentioned in the "Diary." Nor is he more
    correct as to the Countess of Sussex. Lady Anne Fitzroy, as she is
    called in the Peerage books, was married to Lennard Dacre, Earl of
    Sussex, by whom she left a daughter only, who succeeded on her
    father's death to the Barony of Dacre. On the other hand, the Duke
    of Southampton, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Northumberland,
    were all of them children of Charles II. by the Duchess of
    Cleveland.]

10th September, 1676. Dined with me Mr. Flamsted, the learned astrologer
and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new
Observatory in Greenwich Park, furnished with the choicest instruments.
An honest, sincere man.

12th September, 1676. To London, to take order about the building of a
house, or rather an apartment, which had all the conveniences of a
house, for my dear friend, Mr. Godolphin and lady, which I undertook to
contrive and survey, and employ workmen until it should be quite
finished; it being just over against his Majesty's wood-yard by the
Thames side, leading to Scotland Yard.

19th September, 1676. To Lambeth, to that rare magazine of marble, to
take order for chimney-pieces, etc., for Mr. Godolphin's house. The
owner of the works had built for himself a pretty dwelling house; this
Dutchman had contracted with the Genoese for all their marble. We also
saw the Duke of Buckingham's glasswork, where they made huge vases of
metal as clear, ponderous, and thick as crystal; also looking-glasses
far larger and better than any that come from Venice.

9th October, 1676. I went with Mrs. Godolphin and my wife to Blackwall,
to see some Indian curiosities; the streets being slippery, I fell
against a piece of timber with such violence that I could not speak nor
fetch my breath for some space; being carried into a house and let
blood, I was removed to the water-side and so home, where, after a day's
rest, I recovered. This being one of my greatest deliverances, the Lord
Jesus make me ever mindful and thankful!

31st October, 1676. Being my birthday, and fifty-six years old, I spent
the morning in devotion and imploring God's protection, with solemn
thanksgiving for all his signal mercies to me, especially for that
escape which concerned me this month at Blackwall. Dined with Mrs.
Godolphin, and returned home through a prodigious and dangerous mist.

9th November, 1676. Finished the lease of Spalding, for Mr. Godolphin.

16th November, 1676. My son and I dining at my Lord Chamberlain's, he
showed us among others that incomparable piece of Raphael's, being a
Minister of State dictating to Guicciardini, the earnestness of whose
face looking up in expectation of what he was next to write, is so to
the life, and so natural, as I esteem it one of the choicest pieces of
that admirable artist. There was a woman's head of Leonardo da Vinci; a
Madonna of old Palma, and two of Vandyke's, of which one was his own
picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the other, an
eunuch, singing. Rare pieces indeed!

4th December, 1676. I saw the great ball danced by all the gallants and
ladies at the Duchess of York's.

10th December, 1676. There fell so deep a snow as hindered us from
church.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th December, 1676. To London, in so great a snow, as I remember not
to have seen the like.

17th December, 1676. More snow falling, I was not able to get to church.

8th February, 1676-77. I went to Roehampton, with my Lady Duchess of
Ormond. The garden and perspective is pretty, the prospect most
agreeable.

15th May, 1677. Came the Earl of Peterborough, to desire me to be a
trustee for Lord Viscount Mordaunt and the Countess, for the sale of
certain lands set out by Act of Parliament, to pay debts.

12th June, 1677. I went to London, to give the Lord Ambassador Berkeley
(now returned from the treaty at Nimeguen) an account of the great trust
reposed in me during his absence, I having received and remitted to him
no less than £20,000 to my no small trouble and loss of time, that
during his absence, and when the Lord Treasurer was no great friend [of
his] I yet procured him great sums, very often soliciting his Majesty in
his behalf; looking after the rest of his estates and concerns entirely,
without once accepting any kind of acknowledgment, purely upon the
request of my dear friend, Mr. Godolphin. I returned with abundance of
thanks and professions from my Lord Berkeley and my Lady.

29th June, 1677. This business being now at an end, and myself delivered
from that intolerable servitude and correspondence, I had leisure to be
somewhat more at home and to myself.

3d July, 1677. I sealed the deeds of sale of the manor of Blechingley to
Sir Robert Clayton, for payment of Lord Peterborough's debts, according
to the trust of the Act of Parliament.

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

16th July, 1677. I went to Wotton.--22d. Mr. Evans, curate of Abinger,
preached an excellent sermon on Matt. v. 12. In the afternoon, Mr.
Higham at Wotton catechised.

26th July, 1677. I dined at Mr. Duncomb's, at Sheere, whose house stands
environed with very sweet and quick streams.

29th July, 1677. Mr. Bohun, my Son's late tutor, preached at Abinger, on
Phil., iv. 8, very elegantly and practically.

5th August, 1677. I went to visit my Lord Brounker, now taking the
waters at Dulwich.

9th August, 1677. Dined at the Earl of Peterborough's the day after the
marriage of my Lord of Arundel to Lady Mary Mordaunt, daughter of the
Earl of Peterborough.

28th August, 1677. To visit my Lord Chamberlain, in Suffolk; he sent his
coach and six to meet and bring me from St. Edmund's Bury to Euston.

29th August, 1677. We hunted in the Park and killed a very fat buck.

31st August, 1677. I went a hawking.

4th September, 1677. I went to visit my Lord Crofts, now dying at St.
Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity to see this ancient town, and the
remains of that famous monastery and abbey. There is little standing
entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent Gothic
structure, and of great extent. The gates are wood, but quite plated
over with iron. There are also two stately churches, one especially.

5th September, 1677. I went to Thetford, to the borough-town, where
stand the ruins of a religious house: there is a round mountain
artificially raised, either for some castle, or monument, which makes a
pretty landscape. As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his
extraordinary address in the Warren. I also saw the Decoy; much pleased
with the stratagem.

7th September, 1677. There dined this day at my Lord's one Sir John
Gaudy, a very handsome person, but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by
signs, and a very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it was
not possible to discern any imperfection in him. His lady and children
were also there, and he was at church in the morning with us.

9th September, 1677. A stranger preached at Euston Church, and fell into
a handsome panegyric on my Lord's new building the church, which indeed
for its elegance and cheerfulness, is one of the prettiest country
churches in England. My Lord told me his heart smote him that, after he
had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace there, he should see
God's House in the ruin it lay in. He has also rebuilt the
parsonage-house, all of stone, very neat and ample.

[Sidenote: EUSTON]

10th September, 1677. To divert me, my Lord would needs carry me to see
Ipswich, when we dined with one Mr. Mann by the way, who was Recorder of
the town. There were in our company my Lord Huntingtower, son to the
Duchess of Lauderdale, Sir Edward Bacon, a learned gentleman of the
family of the great Chancellor Verulam, and Sir John Felton, with some
other knights and gentlemen. After dinner came the bailiff and
magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment my Lord,
and invite him to the town-house, where they presented us a collation of
dried sweetmeats and wine, the bells ringing, etc. Then, we went to see
the town, and first, the Lord Viscount Hereford's house, which stands in
a park near the town, like that at Brussels, in Flanders; the house not
great, yet pretty, especially the hall. The stews for fish succeeded one
another, and feed one the other, all paved at bottom. There is a good
picture of the blessed virgin in one of the parlors, seeming to be of
Holbein, or some good master. Then we saw the Haven, seven miles from
Harwich. The tide runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it
is safe for shipping and a station. The trade of Ipswich is for the most
part Newcastle coals, with which they supply London; but it was formerly
a clothing town. There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place, a
thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence of the magistrates.
It has in it fourteen or fifteen beautiful churches: in a word, it is
for building, cleanness, and good order, one of the best towns in
England. Cardinal Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there is
little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here, besides a school
and I think a library, which I did not see. His intentions were to build
some great thing. We returned late to Euston, having traveled about
fifty miles this day.

Since first I was at this place, I found things exceedingly improved.
It is seated in a bottom between two graceful swellings, the main
building being now in the figure of a Greek II with four pavilions, two
at each corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustered at the
top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth to keep them
steady upon their pedestals between the statues, which make as good a
show as if they were of stone, and, though the building be of brick, and
but two stories besides cellars and garrets covered with blue slate, yet
there is room enough for a full court, the offices and outhouses being
so ample and well disposed. The King's apartment is painted _à fresco_,
and magnificently furnished. There are many excellent pictures of the
great masters. The gallery is a pleasant, noble room; in the break, or
middle, is a billiard table, but the wainscot, being of fir, and
painted, does not please me so well as Spanish oak without paint. The
chapel is pretty, the porch descending to the gardens. The orange garden
is very fine, and leads into the greenhouse, at the end of which is a
hall to eat in, and the conservatory some hundred feet long, adorned
with maps, as the other side is with the heads of the Cæsars, ill cut in
alabaster; above are several apartments for my Lord, Lady, and Duchess,
with kitchens and other offices below, in a lesser form; lodgings for
servants, all distinct for them to retire to when they please and would
be in private, and have no communication with the palace, which he tells
me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law and daughter, that charming
young creature.

The canal running under my Lady's dressing room chamber window, is full
of carps and fowl, which come and are fed there. The cascade at the end
of the canal turns a cornmill that provides the family, and raises water
for the fountains and offices. To pass this canal into the opposite
meadows, Sir Samuel Morland has invented a screw bridge, which, being
turned with a key, lands you fifty feet distant at the entrance of an
ascending walk of trees, a mile in length,--as it is also on the front
into the park,--of four rows of ash trees, and reaches to the park pale,
which is nine miles in compass, and the best for riding and meeting the
game that I ever saw. There were now of red and fallow deer almost a
thousand, with good covert, but the soil barren and flying sand, in
which nothing will grow kindly. The tufts of fir, and much of the other
wood, were planted by my direction some years before. This seat is
admirably placed for field sports, hawking, hunting, or racing. The
mutton is small, but sweet. The stables hold thirty horses and four
coaches. The out-offices make two large quadrangles, so as servants
never lived with more ease and convenience; never master more civil.
Strangers are attended and accommodated as at their home, in pretty
apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences and privacy.

There is a library full of excellent books; bathing rooms, elaboratory,
dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat fowl in. He had now in
his new church (near the garden) built a dormitory, or vault, with
several repositories, in which to bury his family.

In the expense of this pious structure, the church is most laudable,
most of the houses of God in this country resembling rather stables and
thatched cottages than temples in which to serve the Most High. He has
built a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling, and
might become any gentleman. The same has he done for the parson, little
deserving it for murmuring that my Lord put him some time out of his
wretched hovel, while it was building. He has also erected a fair inn at
some distance from his palace, with a bridge of stone over a river near
it, and repaired all the tenants' houses, so as there is nothing but
neatness and accommodations about his estate, which I yet think is not
above £1,500 a year. I believe he had now in his family one hundred
domestic servants.

His lady (being one of the Brederode's daughters, grandchild to a
natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) is a good-natured and
obliging woman. They love fine things, and to live easily, pompously,
and hospitably; but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord into debts
exceedingly. My Lord himself is given into no expensive vice but
building, and to have all things rich, polite, and princely. He never
plays, but reads much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in
perfection. He has traveled much, and is the best bred and courtly
person his Majesty has about him, so as the public Ministers more
frequent him than any of the rest of the nobility. While he was
Secretary of State and Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent
it as hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain his
greatness; and now beginning to decline in favor (the Duke being no
great friend of his), he knows not how to retrench. He was son of a
Doctor of Laws, whom I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster
School to Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of
Arlington, a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts the Rebellion
falling out, he followed the King's Army, and receiving an HONORABLE
WOUND IN THE FACE, grew into favor, and was advanced from a mean
fortune, at his Majesty's Restoration, to be an Earl and Knight of the
Garter, Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and first favorite for a long
time, during which the King married his natural son, the Duke of
Grafton, to his only daughter and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy
for her beauty and virtue of the greatest prince in Christendom. My Lord
is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person in business, and
speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he has advanced, most of them
proving ungrateful. The many obligations and civilities I have received
from this noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I am
sorry he is in no better circumstances.

Having now passed near three weeks at Euston, to my great satisfaction,
with much difficulty he suffered me to look homeward, being very earnest
with me to stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have carried me
to Lynn-Regis, a town of important traffic, about twenty miles beyond,
which I had never seen; as also the Traveling Sands, about ten miles
wide of Euston, that have so damaged the country, rolling from place to
place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of Lybia, quite overwhelmed
some gentlemen's whole estates, as the relation extant in print, and
brought to our Society, describes at large.

13th September, 1677. My Lord's coach conveyed me to Bury, and thence
baiting at Newmarket, stepping in at Audley-End to see that house again,
I slept at Bishop-Stortford, and, the next day, home. I was accompanied
in my journey by Major Fairfax, of a younger house of the Lord Fairfax,
a soldier, a traveler, an excellent musician, a good-natured, well-bred
gentleman.

18th September, 1677. I preferred Mr. Phillips (nephew of Milton) to the
service of my Lord Chamberlain, who wanted a scholar to read to and
entertain him sometimes.

12th October, 1677. With Sir Robert Clayton to Marden, an estate he had
bought lately of my kinsman, Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, in Surrey,
which from a despicable farmhouse Sir Robert had erected into a seat
with extraordinary expense. It is in such a solitude among hills, as,
being not above sixteen miles from London, seems almost incredible, the
ways up to it are so winding and intricate. The gardens are large, and
well-walled, and the husbandry part made very convenient and perfectly
understood. The barns, the stacks of corn, the stalls for cattle, pigeon
house, etc., of most laudable example. Innumerable are the plantations
of trees, especially walnuts. The orangery and gardens are very curious.
In the house are large and noble rooms. He and his lady (who is very
curious in distillery) entertained me three or four days very freely. I
earnestly suggested to him the repairing of an old desolate dilapidated
church, standing on the hill above the house, which I left him in good
disposition to do, and endow it better; there not being above four or
five houses in the parish, besides that of this prodigious rich
Scrivener. This place is exceedingly sharp in the winter, by reason of
the serpentining of the hills: and it wants running water; but the
solitude much pleased me. All the ground is so full of wild thyme,
marjoram, and other sweet plants, that it cannot be overstocked with
bees; I think he had near forty hives of that industrious insect.

14th October, 1677. I went to church at Godstone, and to see old Sir
John Evelyn's DORMITORY, joining to the church, paved with marble, where
he and his Lady lie on a very stately monument at length; he in armor of
white marble. The inscription is only an account of his particular
branch of the family, on black marble.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th October, 1677. Returned to London; in the evening, I saw the Prince
of Orange, and supped with Lord Ossory.

23d October, 1677. Saw again the Prince of Orange; his marriage with the
Lady Mary, eldest daughter to the Duke of York, by Mrs. Hyde, the late
Duchess, was now declared.

11th November, 1677. I was all this week composing matters between old
Mrs. Howard and Sir Gabriel Sylvius, upon his long and earnest addresses
to Mrs. Anne, her second daughter, maid of honor to the Queen. My
friend, Mrs. Godolphin (who exceedingly loved the young lady) was most
industrious in it, out of pity to the languishing knight; so as though
there were great differences in their years, it was at last effected,
and they were married the 13th, in Henry VII.'s Chapel, by the Bishop of
Rochester, there being besides my wife and Mrs. Graham, her sister, Mrs.
Godolphin, and very few more. We dined at the old lady's, and supped at
Mr. Graham's at St. James's.

15th November, 1677. The Queen's birthday, a great ball at Court, where
the Prince of Orange and his new Princess danced.

19th November, 1677. They went away, and I saw embarked my Lady Sylvius,
who went into Holland with her husband, made Hoffmaester to the Prince,
a considerable employment. We parted with great sorrow, for the great
respect and honor I bore her, a most pious and virtuous lady.

27th November, 1677. Dined at the Lord Treasurer's with Prince Rupert,
Viscount Falkenburg, Earl of Bath, Lord O'Brien, Sir John Lowther, Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr. Grew, and other learned men.

30th November, 1677. Sir Joseph Williamson, Principal Secretary of
State, was chosen President of the Royal Society, after my Lord Viscount
Brouncker had possessed the chair now sixteen years successively, and
therefore now thought fit to CHANGE, that prescription might not
prejudice.

4th December, 1677. Being the first day of his taking the chair, he gave
us a magnificent supper.

20th December, 1677. Carried to my Lord Treasurer an account of the Earl
of Bristol's Library, at Wimbledon, which my Lord thought of purchasing,
till I acquainted him that it was a very broken collection, consisting
much in books of judicial astrology, romances, and trifles.

25th December, 1677. I gave my son an office, with instructions how to
govern his youth; I pray God give him the grace to make a right use of
it!

23d January, 1677-78. Dined with the Duke of Norfolk, being the first
time I had seen him since the death of his elder brother, who died at
Padua in Italy, where he had resided above thirty years. The Duke had
now newly declared his marriage to his concubine, whom he promised me he
never would marry. I went with him to see the Duke of Buckingham, thence
to my Lord Sunderland, now Secretary of State, to show him that rare
piece of Vosterman's (son of old Vosterman), which was a view, or
landscape of my Lord's palace, etc., at Althorpe in Northamptonshire.

8th February, 1678. Supping at my Lord Chamberlain's I had a long
discourse with the Count de Castel Mellor, lately Prime Minister in
Portugal, who, taking part with his master, King Alphonso, was banished
by his brother, Don Pedro, now Regent; but had behaved himself so
uncorruptly in all his ministry that, though he was acquitted, and his
estate restored, yet would they not suffer him to return. He is a very
intelligent and worthy gentleman.

18th February, 1678. My Lord Treasurer sent for me to accompany him to
Wimbledon, which he had lately purchased of the Earl of Bristol; so
breaking fast with him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with
two of his daughters, my Lord Conway, and Sir Bernard Gascoyne; and,
having surveyed his gardens and alterations, returned late at night.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d February, 1678. Dr. Pierce preached at Whitehall, on 2 Thessalonians
iii. 6, against our late schismatics, in a rational discourse, but a
little over-sharp, and not at all proper for the auditory there.

22d March, 1678. Dr. South preached _coram Rege_, an incomparable
discourse on this text, "A wounded spirit who can bear!" Note: Now was
our Communion table placed altarwise; the church steeple, clock, and
other reparations finished.

16th April, 1678. I showed Don Emmanuel de Lyra (Portugal Ambassador)
and the Count de Castel Mellor, the Repository of the Royal Society, and
the College of Physicians.

18th April, 1678. I went to see new Bedlam Hospital, magnificently
built, and most sweetly placed in Moorfields, since the dreadful fire in
London.

28th June, 1678. I went to Windsor with my Lord Chamberlain (the castle
now repairing with exceeding cost) to see the rare work of Verrio, an
incomparable carving of Gibbons.

29th June, 1678. Returned with my Lord by Hounslow Heath, where we saw
the newly raised army encamped, designed against France, in pretense, at
least; but which gave umbrage to the Parliament. His Majesty and a world
of company were in the field, and the whole army in battalia; a very
glorious sight. Now were brought into service a new sort of soldiers,
called GRENADIERS, who were dexterous in flinging hand grenades,
everyone having a pouch full; they had furred caps with coped crowns
like Janizaries, which made them look very fierce, and some had long
hoods hanging down behind, as we picture fools. Their clothing being
likewise piebald, yellow and red.

8th July, 1678. Came to dine with me my Lord Longford, Treasurer of
Ireland, nephew to that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, with whom I
was long since acquainted; also the Lady Stidolph, and other company.

19th July, 1678. The Earl of Ossory came to take his leave of me, going
into Holland to command the English forces.

20th July, 1678. I went to the Tower to try a metal at the
Assay-master's, which only proved sulphur; then saw Monsieur Rotière,
that excellent graver belonging to the Mint, who emulates even the
ancients, in both metal and stone;[38] he was now molding a horse for
the King's statue, to be cast in silver, of a yard high. I dined with
Mr. Slingsby, Master of the Mint.

    [Footnote 38: Doubtless Philip Rotière, who introduced the figure of
    Britannia into the coinage, taking for his model the King's
    favorite, Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.]

23d July, 1678. Went to see Mr. Elias Ashmole's library and curiosities,
at Lambeth. He had divers MSS., but most of them astrological, to which
study he is addicted, though I believe not learned, but very
industrious, as his History of the order of the Garter proves. He showed
me a toad included in amber. The prospect from a turret is very fine, it
being so near London, and yet not discovering any house about the
country. The famous John Tradescant bequeathed his Repository to this
gentleman, who has given them to the University of Oxford, and erected a
lecture on them, over the laboratory, in imitation of the Royal Society.

Mr. Godolphin was made master of the robes to the King.

25th July, 1678. There was sent me £70; from whom I knew not, to be by
me distributed among poor people; I afterward found it was from that
dear friend (Mrs. Godolphin), who had frequently given me large sums to
bestow on charities.

16th August, 1678. I went to Lady Mordaunt, who put £100 into my hand to
dispose of for pious uses, relief of prisoners, poor, etc. Many a sum
had she sent me on similar occasions; a blessed creature she was, and
one that loved and feared God exemplarily.

[Sidenote: WEYBRIDGE]

23d August, 1678. Upon Sir Robert Reading's importunity, I went to visit
the Duke of Norfolk, at his new palace at Weybridge, where he has laid
out in building near £10,000, on a copyhold, and in a miserable, barren,
sandy place by the street side; never in my life had I seen such expense
to so small purpose. The rooms are wainscotted, and some of them richly
pargeted with cedar, yew, cypress, etc. There are some good pictures,
especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where the Duke of
Norfolk, Charles Brandon and Henry VIII., are dancing with the three
ladies, with most amorous countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely
expressed. It is a thousand pities (as I told my Lord of Arundel, his
son), that that jewel should be given away.

24th August, 1678. I went to see my Lord of St. Alban's house, at
Byfleet, an old, large building. Thence, to the papermills, where I
found them making a coarse white paper. They cull the rags which are
linen for white paper, woolen for brown; then they stamp them in troughs
to a pap, with pestles, or hammers, like the powder mills, then put it
into a vessel of water, in which they dip a frame closely wired with
wire as small as a hair and as close as a weaver's reed; on this they
take up the pap, the superfluous water draining through the wire; this
they dexterously turning, shake out like a pancake on a smooth board
between two pieces of flannel, then press it between a great press, the
flannel sucking out the moisture; then, taking it out, they ply and dry
it on strings, as they dry linen in the laundry; then dip it in alum
water, lastly, polish and make it up in quires. They put some gum in the
water in which they macerate the rags. The mark we find on the sheets is
formed in the wire.

25th August, 1678. After evening prayer, visited Mr. Sheldon (nephew to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury), and his pretty melancholy garden; I
took notice of the largest _arbor thuyris_ I had ever seen. The place is
finely watered, and there are many curiosities of India, shown in the
house.

There was at Weybridge the Duchess of Norfolk, Lord Thomas Howard (a
worthy and virtuous gentleman, with whom my son was sometime bred in
Arundel House), who was newly come from Rome, where he had been some
time; also one of the Duke's daughters, by his first lady. My Lord
leading me about the house made no scruple of showing me all the hiding
places for the Popish priests, and where they said mass, for he was no
bigoted Papist. He told me he never trusted them with any secret, and
used Protestants only in all businesses of importance.

I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor, where was a
magnificent Court, it being the first time of his Majesty's removing
thither since it was repaired.

27th August, 1678. I took leave of the Duke, and dined at Mr. Henry
Bruncker's, at the Abbey of Sheene, formerly a monastery of Carthusians,
there yet remaining one of their solitary cells with a cross. Within
this ample inclosure are several pretty villas and fine gardens of the
most excellent fruits, especially Sir William Temple's (lately
Ambassador into Holland), and the Lord Lisle's, son to the Earl of
Leicester, who has divers rare pictures, above all, that of Sir Brian
Tuke's, by Holbein.

After dinner I walked to Ham, to see the house and garden of the Duke of
Lauderdale, which is indeed inferior to few of the best villas in Italy
itself; the house furnished like a great Prince's; the parterres,
flower-gardens, orangeries, groves, avenues, courts, statues,
perspectives, fountains, aviaries, and all this at the banks of the
sweetest river in the world, must needs be admirable.

Hence, I went to my worthy friend, Sir Henry Capel [at Kew], brother to
the Earl of Essex; it is an old timber-house; but his garden has the
choicest fruit of any plantation in England, as he is the most
industrious and understanding in it.

29th August, 1678. I was called to London to wait upon the Duke of
Norfolk, who having at my sole request bestowed the Arundelian Library
on the Royal Society; sent to me to take charge of the books, and remove
them, only stipulating that I would suffer the Herald's chief officer,
Sir William Dugdale, to have such of them as concerned heraldry and the
marshal's office, books of armory and genealogies, the Duke being Earl
Marshal of England. I procured for our Society, besides printed books,
near one hundred MSS. some in Greek of great concernment. The printed
books being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I
esteem them almost equal to MSS. Among them, are most of the Fathers,
printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them with their expurgatory
Indexes; there is a noble MS. of Vitruvius. Many of these books had been
presented by Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of
Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel
bought a noble library in Germany, which is in this collection. I should
not, for the honor I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part
with these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they pleased; so
that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone.

Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society to give them an
account of what I had procured, that they might call a Council and
appoint a day to wait on the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d September, 1678. I went to London, to dine with Mrs. Godolphin, and
found her in labor; she was brought to bed of a son, who was baptized in
the chamber, by the name of Francis, the susceptors being Sir William
Godolphin (head of the family), Mr. John Hervey, Treasurer to the Queen,
and Mrs. Boscawen, sister to Sir William and the father.

8th September, 1678. While I was at church came a letter from Mr.
Godolphin, that my dear friend his lady was exceedingly ill, and
desiring my prayers and assistance. My wife and I took boat immediately,
and went to Whitehall, where, to my inexpressible sorrow, I found she
had been attacked with a new fever, then reigning this excessive hot
autumn, and which was so violent, that it was not thought she could last
many hours.

9th September, 1678. She died in the 26th year of her age, to the
inexpressible affliction of her dear husband, and all her relations, but
of none in the world more than of myself, who lost the most excellent
and inestimable friend that ever lived. Never was a more virtuous and
inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet, and admirable
creature, beloved of all, admired of all, for all possible perfections
of her sex. She is gone to receive the reward of her signal charity, and
all other her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse with
mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to be received into the
mansions above. She was for wit, beauty, good nature, fidelity,
discretion, and all accomplishments, the most incomparable person. How
shall I ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good offices
she did my soul by so often engaging me to make religion the terms and
tie of the friendship there was between us! She was the best wife, the
best mistress, the best friend, that ever husband had. But it is not
here that I pretend to give her character, HAVING DESIGNED TO CONSECRATE
HER WORTHY LIFE TO POSTERITY.

Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell down as dead. The
King himself, and all the Court, expressed their sorrow. To the poor and
miserable, her loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had
some obligation to her memory. So careful and provident was she to be
prepared for all possible accidents, that (as if she foresaw her end)
she received the heavenly viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most
solemn recollection. She put all her domestic concerns into the exactest
order, and left a letter directed to her husband, to be opened in case
she died in childbed, in which with the most pathetic and endearing
expressions of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness
to her memory might be continued by his care and esteem of those she
left behind, even to her domestic servants, to the meanest of which she
left considerable legacies, as well as to the poor. It was now seven
years since she was maid of honor to the Queen, that she regarded me as
a father, a brother, and what is more, a friend. We often prayed,
visited the sick and miserable, received, read, discoursed, and
communicated in all holy offices together. She was most dear to my wife,
and affectionate to my children. But she is gone! This only is my
comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall shortly behold her
again. She desired to be buried in the dormitory of his family, near
three hundred miles from all her other friends. So afflicted was her
husband at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral was
committed to me. Having closed the eyes, and dropped a tear upon the
cheek of my dear departed friend, lovely even in death, I caused her
corpse to be embalmed and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered
thereon, with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her worth,
with as much diligence and care as my grieved heart would permit me; I
then retired home for two days, which were spent in solitude and sad
reflection.

17th September, 1678. She was, accordingly, carried to Godolphin, in
Cornwall, in a hearse with six horses, attended by two coaches of as
many, with about thirty of her relations and servants. There accompanied
the hearse her husband's brother, Sir William, two more of his brothers,
and three sisters; her husband was so overcome with grief, that he was
wholly unfit to travel so long a journey, till he was more composed. I
went as far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to return upon
some indispensable affairs. The corpse was ordered to be taken out of
the hearse every night, and decently placed in the house, with tapers
about it, and her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was
honorably interred in the parish church of Godolphin. This funeral cost
not much less than £1,000.

With Mr. Godolphin, I looked over and sorted his lady's papers, most of
which consisted of Prayers, Meditations, Sermon-notes, Discourses, and
Collections on several religious subjects, and many of her own happy
composing, and so pertinently digested, as if she had been all her life
a student in divinity. We found a diary of her solemn resolutions,
tending to practical virtue, with letters from select friends, all put
into exact method. It astonished us to see what she had read and
written, her youth considered.

1st October, 1678. The Parliament and the whole Nation were alarmed
about a conspiracy of some eminent Papists for the destruction of the
King and introduction of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr.
Tongue,[39] WHICH LAST I KNEW, BEING THE TRANSLATOR OF THE "Jesuits'
Morals"; I went to see and converse with him at Whitehall, with Mr.
Oates, one that was lately an apostate to the church of Rome, and now
returned again with this discovery. He seemed to be a bold man, and, in
my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed what he said;
and it quite changed the genius and motions of the Parliament, growing
now corrupt and interested with long sitting and court practices; but,
with all this, Popery would not go down. This discovery turned them all
as one man against it, and nothing was done but to find out the depth of
this. Oates was encouraged, and everything he affirmed taken for gospel;
the truth is, the Roman Catholics were exceedingly bold and busy
everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to the chapel.

    [Footnote 39: Ezrael Tonge was bred in University College, Oxford,
    and being puritanically inclined, quitted the University; but in
    1648 returned, and was made a Fellow. He had the living of Pluckley,
    in Kent, which he resigned in consequence of quarrels with his
    parishioners and Quakers. In 1657, he was made fellow of the
    newly-erected College at Durham, and that being dissolved in 1660,
    he taught school at Islington. He then went with Colonel Edward
    Harley to Dunkirk, and subsequently took a small living in
    Herefordshire (Lentwardine); but quitted it for St. Mary Stayning,
    in London, which, after the fire in 1666, was united to St. Michael,
    Wood Street. These he held till his death, in 1680. He was a great
    opponent of the Roman Catholics. Wood mentions several publications
    of his, among which are, "The Jesuits Unmasked," 1678; "Jesuitical
    Aphorisms," 1678; and "The Jesuits' Morals," 1680 (1670); the two
    latter translated from the French. (Wood's "_Athenæ, Oxon._" vol.
    ii. p. 502.) Evelyn speaks of the last of these translations as
    having been executed by his desire: and it figures in a notable
    passage of Oates's testimony. Oates said, for example, "that Thomas
    Whitbread, a priest, on 13th of June, 16 . . did tell the rector of
    St. Omer's that a Minister of the Church of England had scandalously
    put out the 'Jesuits' Morals' in English, and had endeavored to
    render them odious, and had asked the Rector whether he thought
    Oates might know him? and the Rector called, the deponent, who heard
    these words as he stood at the chamber door, and when he went into
    the chamber of the Provincial, he asked him 'If he knew the author
    of the "Jesuits' Morals?"' deponent answered, 'His person, but not
    his name.' Whitbread then demanded, whether he would undertake to
    poison, or assassinate the author; which deponent undertook, having
    £50 reward promised him, and appointed to return to England."]

16th October, 1678. Mr. Godolphin requested me to continue the trust his
wife had reposed in me, in behalf of his little son, conjuring me to
transfer the friendship I had for his dear wife, on him and his.

21st October, 1678. The murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, found
strangled about this time, as was manifest, by the Papists, he being the
Justice of the Peace, and one who knew much of their practices, as
conversant with Coleman (a servant of the ... now accused), put the
whole nation into a new ferment against them.

31st October, 1678. Being the 58th of my age, required my humble
addresses to Almighty God, and that he would take off his heavy hand,
still on my family; and restore comforts to us after the death of my
excellent friend.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1678. Dr. Tillotson preached before the Commons at St.
Margaret's. He said the Papists were now arrived at that impudence, as
to deny that there ever was any such as the gunpowder-conspiracy; but he
affirmed that he himself had several letters written by Sir Everard
Digby (one of the traitors), in which he gloried that he was to suffer
for it; and that it was so contrived, that of the Papists not above two
or three should have been blown up, and they, such as were not worth
saving.

15th November, 1678. The Queen's birthday. I never saw the Court more
brave, nor the nation in more apprehension and consternation. Coleman
and one Staly had now been tried, condemned, and executed. On this,
Oates grew so presumptuous as to accuse the Queen of intending to poison
the King; which certainly that pious and virtuous lady abhorred the
thoughts of, and Oates's circumstances made it utterly unlikely in my
opinion. He probably thought to gratify some who would have been glad
his Majesty should have married a fruitful lady; but the King was too
kind a husband to let any of these make impression on him. However,
divers of the Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates; and
all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act forever excluded the
Parliament; which was a mighty blow. The King's, Queen's, and Duke's
servants, were banished, and a test to be taken by everybody who
pretended to enjoy any office of public trust, and who would not be
suspected of Popery. I went with Sir William Godolphin, a member of the
Commons' House, to the Bishop of Ely (Dr. Peter Gunning), to be resolved
whether masses were idolatry, as the text expressed it, which was so
worded, that several good Protestants scrupled, and Sir William, though
a learned man and excellent divine himself, had some doubts about it.
The Bishop's opinion was that he might take it, though he wished it had
been otherwise worded in the text.

15th January, 1678-79. I went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsa, and
dined with the Countess of Bristol [her mother] in the great house,
formerly the Duke of Buckingham's, a spacious and excellent place for
the extent of ground and situation in a good air. The house is large but
ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol, who purchased it after he sold
Wimbledon to my Lord Treasurer, expended much money on it. There were
divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and some of Bassano, very
excellent, especially an Adonis and Venus, a Duke of Venice, a butcher
in his shambles selling meat to a Swiss; and of Vandyke, my Lord of
Bristol's picture, with the Earl of Bedford's at length, in the same
table. There was in the garden a rare collection of orange trees, of
which she was pleased to bestow some upon me.

16th January, 1679. I supped this night with Mr. Secretary at one Mr.
Houblon's, a French merchant, who had his house furnished _en Prince_,
and gave us a splendid entertainment.

25th January, 1679. The Long Parliament, which had sat ever since the
Restoration, was dissolved by persuasion of the Lord Treasurer, though
divers of them were believed to be his pensioner. At this, all the
politicians were at a stand, they being very eager in pursuit of the
late plot of the Papists.

30th January, 1679. Dr. Cudworth preached before the King at Whitehall,
on 2 Timothy iii. 5, reckoning up the perils of the last times, in
which, among other wickedness, treasons should be one of the greatest,
applying it to the occasion, as committed under a form of reformation
and godliness; concluding that the prophecy did intend more particularly
the present age, as one of the last times; the sins there enumerated,
more abundantly reigning than ever.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d February, 1679. Dr. Durell, Dean of Windsor, preached to the
household at Whitehall, on 1 Cor. xvi. 22; he read the whole sermon out
of his notes, which I had never before seen a Frenchman do, he being of
Jersey, and bred at Paris.

4th February, 1679. Dr. Pierce, Dean of Salisbury, preached on 1 John,
iv. 1, "Try the Spirits, there being so many delusory ones gone forth of
late into the world"; he inveighed against the pernicious doctrines of
Mr. Hobbes.

My brother Evelyn, was now chosen Knight for the County of Surrey,
carrying it against my Lord Longford and Sir Adam Brown, of Bechworth
Castle. The country coming in to give him their suffrages were so many,
that I believe they ate and drank him out near £2,000, by a most
abominable custom.

1st April, 1679. My friend, Mr. Godolphin, was now made one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, and of the Privy Council.

4th April, 1679. The Bishop of Gloucester preached in a manner very like
Bishop Andrews, full of divisions, and scholastical, and that with much
quickness. The Holy Communion followed.

20th April, 1679. EASTER DAY. Our vicar preached exceedingly well on 1
Cor. v. 7. The Holy Communion followed, at which I and my daughter, Mary
(now about fourteen years old), received for the first time. The Lord
Jesus continue his grace unto her, and improve this blessed beginning!

24th April, 1679. The Duke of York, voted against by the Commons for his
recusancy, went over to Flanders; which made much discourse.

4th June, 1679. I dined with Mr. Pepys in the Tower, he having been
committed by the House of Commons for misdemeanors in the Admiralty when
he was secretary; I believe he was unjustly charged. Here I saluted my
Lords Stafford and Petre, who were committed for the Popish plot.

7th June, 1679. I saw the magnificent cavalcade and entry of the
Portugal Ambassador.

17th June, 1679. I was godfather to a son of Sir Christopher Wren,
surveyor of his Majesty's buildings, that most excellent and learned
person, with Sir William Fermor, and my Lady Viscountess Newport, wife
of the Treasurer of the Household.

Thence to Chelsea, to Sir Stephen Fox, and my lady, in order to the
purchase of the Countess of Bristol's house there, which she desired me
to procure a chapman for.

19th June, 1679. I dined at Sir Robert Clayton's with Sir Robert Viner,
the great banker.

22d June, 1679. There were now divers Jesuits executed about the plot,
and a rebellion in Scotland of the fanatics, so that there was a sad
prospect of public affairs.

25th June, 1679. The new Commissioners of the Admiralty came to visit
me, viz, Sir Henry Capell, brother to the Earl of Essex, Mr. Finch,
eldest son to the Lord Chancellor, Sir Humphry Winch, Sir Thomas Meeres,
Mr. Hales, with some of the Commissioners of the Navy. I went with them
to London.

1st July, 1679. I dined at Sir William Godolphin's, and with that
learned gentleman went to take the air in Hyde Park, where was a
glorious _cortège_.

3d July, 1679. Sending a piece of venison to Mr. Pepys, still a
prisoner, I went and dined with him.

6th July, 1679. Now were there papers, speeches, and libels, publicly
cried in the streets against the Dukes of York and Lauderdale, etc.,
obnoxious to the Parliament, with too much and indeed too shameful a
liberty; but the people and Parliament had gotten head by reason of the
vices of the great ones.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was now brought up to London a child, son of one Mr. Wotton,
formerly amanuensis to Dr. Andrews, Bishop of Winton, who both read and
perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and most of
the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all the sciences;
was skillful in history, both ecclesiastical and profane; in politics;
in a word, so universally and solidly learned at eleven years of age,
that he was looked on as a miracle. Dr. Lloyd, one of the most deeply
learned divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr.
Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away astonished, and they
told me they did not believe there had the like appeared in the world.
He had only been instructed by his father, who being himself a learned
person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself knew. But, what
was more admirable than his vast memory, was his judgment and invention,
he being tried with divers hard questions, which required maturity of
thought and experience. He was also dexterous in chronology,
antiquities, mathematics. In sum, an _intellectus universalis_, beyond
all that we read of Picus Mirandula, and other precocious wits, and yet
withal a very humble child.

14th July, 1679. I went to see how things stood at Parson's Green, my
Lady Viscountess Mordaunt (now sick in Paris, whither she went for
health) having made me a trustee for her children, an office I could not
refuse to this most excellent, pious, and virtuous lady, my long
acquaintance.

15th July, 1679. I dined with Mr. Sidney Godolphin, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.

18th July, 1679. I went early to the Old Bailey Sessions House, to the
famous trial of Sir George Wakeman, one of the Queen's physicians, and
three Benedictine monks; the first (whom I was well acquainted with, and
take to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact), for intending to
poison the King; the others as accomplices to carry on the plot, to
subvert the government, and introduce Popery. The bench was crowded with
the judges, Lord Mayor justices, and innumerable spectators. The chief
accusers, Dr. Oates (as he called himself), and one Bedlow, a man of
inferior note. Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I fear much
of it from hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars, which
drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances so agree, as to
give either the bench or jury so entire satisfaction as was expected.
After, therefore, a long and tedious trial of nine hours, the jury
brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the Papists,
and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections on witnesses,
especially Oates and Bedlow.

This was a happy day for the lords in the Tower, who, expecting their
trial, had this gone against the prisoners at the bar, would all have
been in the utmost hazard. For my part, I look on Oates as a vain,
insolent man, puffed up with the favor of the Commons for having
discovered something really true, more especially as detecting the
dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a
general design which the Jesuited party of the Papists ever had and
still have, to ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted with
those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid ground for what he
accused divers noblemen of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary
belief. That among so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered
to them from P. Oliva[40] and the Pope,--he who made no scruple of
opening all other papers, letters, and secrets, should not only not open
any of those pretended commissions, but not so much as take any copy or
witness of any one of them, is almost miraculous. But the Commons (some
leading persons I mean of them) had so exalted him that they took all he
said for Gospel, and without more ado ruined all whom he named to be
conspirators; nor did he spare whoever came in his way. But, indeed, the
murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, suspected to have been compassed by
the Jesuits' party for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I
also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to have discovered
things to their prejudice, did so exasperate not only the Commons, but
all the nation, that much of these sharpnesses against the more honest
Roman Catholics who lived peaceably, is to be imputed to that horrid
fact.

    [Footnote 40: Padrè Oliva, General of the Order of Jesuits.]

The sessions ended, I dined or rather supped (so late it was) with the
judges in the large room annexed to the place, and so returned home.
Though it was not my custom or delight to be often present at any
capital trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by those
who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to be at this signal
one, that by the ocular view of the carriages and other circumstances of
the managers and parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate
my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole nation.

22d July, 1679. Dined at Clapham, at Sir D. Gauden's; went thence with
him to Windsor, to assist him in a business with his Majesty. I lay that
night at Eton College, the Provost's lodgings (Dr. Craddock), where I
was courteously entertained.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d July, 1679. To Court: after dinner, I visited that excellent
painter, Verrio, whose works in _fresco_ in the King's palace, at
Windsor, will celebrate his name as long as those walls last. He showed
us his pretty garden, choice flowers, and curiosities, he himself being
a skillful gardener.

I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood, and prospect, of
the Duke of Buckingham's, and buildings of extraordinary expense. The
grots in the chalky rocks are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the
place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made
of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute to a thing
so very like their imaginations. The stand, somewhat like Frascati as to
its front, and on the platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of
the horizon, which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable. The
staircase is for its materials singular; the cloisters, descents,
gardens, and avenue through the wood, august and stately; but the land
all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing but fern. Indeed, as
I told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without
flattery, that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect
and park, which is without compare; there being but one only opening,
and that narrow, which led one to any variety; whereas that of Windsor
is everywhere great and unconfined.

Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a very pretty seat in
the forest, two miles by hither Clifden, on a flat, with gardens
exquisitely kept, though large, and the house a staunch good old
building, and what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove
tail-wise without a nail, exactly close. One of the closets is pargeted
with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch and pretty.

7th August, 1679. Dined at the Sheriff's, when, the Company of Drapers
and their wives being invited, there was a sumptuous entertainment,
according to the forms of the city, with music, etc., comparable to any
prince's service in Europe.

8th August, 1679. I went this morning to show my Lord Chamberlain, his
Lady, and the Duchess of Grafton, the incomparable work of Mr. Gibbon,
the carver, whom I first recommended to his Majesty, his house being
furnished like a cabinet, not only with his own work, but divers
excellent paintings of the best hands. Thence, to Sir Stephen Fox's,
where we spent the day.

31st August, 1679. After evening service, to see a neighbor, one Mr.
Bohun, related to my son's late tutor of that name, a rich Spanish
merchant, living in a neat place, which he has adorned with many
curiosities, especially several carvings of Mr. Gibbons, and some
pictures by Streeter.

13th September, 1679. To Windsor, to congratulate his Majesty on his
recovery; I kissed the Duke's hand, now lately returned from
Flanders[41] to visit his brother the King, on which there were various
bold and foolish discourses, the Duke of Monmouth being sent away.

    [Footnote 41: He returned the day before, the 12th of September.
    This is another of the indications that the entries of this Diary
    were not always made on the precise days they refer to.]

19th September, 1679. My Lord Sunderland, one of the principal
Secretaries of State, invited me to dinner, where was the King's natural
son, the Earl of Plymouth, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Essex, Earl
of Mulgrave, Mr. Hyde, and Mr. Godolphin. After dinner I went to prayers
at Eton, and visited Mr. Henry Godolphin, fellow there, and Dr.
Craddock.

25th September, 1679. Mr. Slingsby and Signor Verrio came to dine with
me, to whom I gave China oranges off my own trees, as good, I think, as
were ever eaten.

6th October, 1679. A very wet and sickly season.

23d October, 1679. Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, the King being now
newly returned from his Newmarket recreations.

4th November, 1679. Dined at the Lord Mayor's; and, in the evening, went
to the funeral of my pious, dear, and ancient learned friend, Dr. Jasper
Needham, who was buried at St. Bride's Church. He was a true and holy
Christian, and one who loved me with great affection. Dr. Dove preached
with an eulogy due to his memory. I lost in this person one of my
dearest remaining sincere friends.

5th November, 1679. I was invited to dine at my Lord Teviotdale's, a
Scotch Earl, a learned and knowing nobleman. We afterward went to see
Mr. Montague's new palace near Bloomsbury, built by our curator, Mr.
Hooke, somewhat after the French; it was most nobly furnished, and a
fine, but too much exposed garden.[42]

    [Footnote 42: Now the British Museum.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th November, 1679. Dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, and was this
evening at the remarriage of the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his
Majesty's natural son), she being now twelve years old. The ceremony was
performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her father's) lodgings at Whitehall
by the Bishop of Rochester, his Majesty being present. A sudden and
unexpected thing, when everybody believed the first marriage would have
come to nothing; but, the measure being determined, I was privately
invited by my Lady, her mother, to be present. I confess I could give
her little joy, and so I plainly told her, but she said the King would
have it so, and there was no going back. This sweetest, most hopeful,
most beautiful, child, and most virtuous, too, was sacrificed to a boy
that had been rudely bred, without anything to encourage them but his
Majesty's pleasure. I pray God the sweet child find it to her advantage,
who, if my augury deceive me not, will in a few years be such a paragon
as were fit to make the wife of the greatest Prince in Europe! I staid
supper, where his Majesty sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the
mother of the Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there
were several great persons and ladies, without pomp. My love to my Lord
Arlington's family, and the sweet child made me behold all this with
regret, though as the Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find
his father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful and robust
officer: and were he polished, a tolerable person; for he is exceedingly
handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other natural issue.

8th November, 1679. At Sir Stephen Fox's, and was agreeing for the
Countess of Bristol's house at Chelsea, within £500.

18th November, 1679. I dined at my Lord Mayor's, being desired by the
Countess of Sunderland to carry her thither on a solemn day, that she
might see the pomp and ceremony of this Prince of Citizens, there never
having been any, who for the stateliness of his palace, prodigious
feasting, and magnificence, exceeded him. This Lord Mayor's acquaintance
had been from the time of his being apprentice to one Mr. Abbot, his
uncle, who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, one who was
condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles forty years past, as
concerned in the commission of array for King Charles I. had escaped
with his life; I often used his assistance in money matters. Robert
Clayton, then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's death,
so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned one of the
wealthiest citizens. He married a free-hearted woman, who became his
hospitable disposition; and having no children, with the accession of
his partner and fellow apprentice, who also left him his estate, he grew
excessively rich. He was a discreet magistrate, and though envied, I
think without much cause. Some believed him guilty of hard dealing,
especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had
swallowed, but I never saw any ill by him, considering the trade he was
of. The reputation and known integrity of his uncle, Abbot, brought all
the royal party to him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast
wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence and
honor.

20th November, 1679. I dined with Mr. Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with
my wife, invited to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by four
of the most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute; Signor
Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao on the violin;
but, above all, for its sweetness and novelty, the _viol d'amore_ of
five wire strings played on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin,
played on lyre-way, by a German. There was also a _flute douce_, now in
much request for accompanying the voice. Mr. Slingsby, whose son and
daughter played skillfully, had these meetings frequently in his house.

21st November, 1679. I dined at my Lord Mayor's, to accompany my
worthiest and generous friend, the Earl of Ossory; it was on a Friday, a
private day, but the feast and entertainment might have become a King.
Such an hospitable costume and splendid magistrature does no city in the
world show, as I believe.

23d November, 1679. Dr. Allestree preached before the household on St.
Luke xi. 2; Dr. Lloyd on Matt. xxiii. 20, before the King, showing with
how little reason the Papists applied those words of our blessed Savior
to maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of. I never heard a
more Christian and excellent discourse; yet were some offended that he
seemed to say the Church of Rome was a true church; but it was a
captious mistake; for he never affirmed anything that could be more to
their reproach, and that such was the present Church of Rome, showing
how much it had erred. There was not in this sermon so much as a shadow
for censure, no person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal
against the errors of the Papists than this pious and most learned
person. I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, and then went to St.
Paul's to hear that great wit, Dr. Sprat, now newly succeeding Dr.
Outram, in the cure of St. Margaret's. His talent was a great memory,
never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a most pure and
plain style of words, full of matter, easily delivered.

26th November, 1679. I met the Earl of Clarendon with the rest of my
fellow executors of the Will of my late Lady Viscountess Mordaunt,
namely, Mr. Laurence Hyde, one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, and
lately Plenipotentiary-Ambassador at Nimeguen; Andrew Newport; and Sir
Charles Wheeler; to examine and audit and dispose of this year's account
of the estate of this excellent Lady, according to the direction of her
Will.

27th November, 1679. I went to see Sir John Stonehouse, with whom I was
treating a marriage between my son and his daughter-in-law.

28th November, 1679. Came over the Duke of Monmouth from Holland
unexpectedly to his Majesty; while the Duke of York was on his journey
to Scotland, whither the King sent him to reside and govern. The bells
and bonfires of the city at this arrival of the Duke of Monmouth
publishing their joy, to the no small regret of some at Court. This
Duke, whom for distinction they called the Protestant Duke (though the
son of an abandoned woman), the people made their idol.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th December, 1679. I dined, together with Lord Ossory and the Earl of
Chesterfield, at the Portugal Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland
House, a noble palace, too good for that infamous.... The staircase is
sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but, above all, the costly
furniture belonging to the Ambassador, especially the rich Japan
cabinets, of which I think there were a dozen. There was a billiard
table, with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the game being
only to prosecute the ball till hazarded, without passing the port, or
touching the pin; if one miss hitting the ball every time, the game is
lost, or if hazarded. It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though so
many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made so exactly even,
and the edges not stuffed; the balls are also bigger, and they for the
most part use the sharp and small end of the billiard stick, which is
shod with brass, or silver. The entertainment was exceedingly civil;
but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed and condited
after their way, not at all fit for an English stomach, which is for
solid meat. There was yet good fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the
sweetmeats good.

30th December, 1679. I went to meet Sir John Stonehouse, and give him a
particular of the settlement on my son, who now made his addresses to
the young lady his daughter-in-law, daughter of Lady Stonehouse.

25th January, 1679-80. Dr. Cave, author of "Primitive Christianity,"
etc., a pious and learned man, preached at Whitehall to the household,
on James iii. 17, concerning the duty of grace and charity.

30th January, 1680. I supped with Sir Stephen Fox, now made one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

19th February, 1680. The writings for the settling jointure and other
contracts of marriage of my son were finished and sealed. The lady was
to bring £5,000, in consideration of a settlement of £500 a year present
maintenance, which was likewise to be her jointure, and £500 a year
after mine and my wife's decease. But, with God's blessing, it will be
at the least £1,000 a year more in a few years. I pray God make him
worthy of it, and a comfort to his excellent mother, who deserves much
from him!

21st February, 1680. SHROVE-TUESDAY. My son was married to Mrs. Martha
Spencer, daughter to my Lady Stonehouse by a former gentleman, at St.
Andrew's, Holborn, by our Vicar, borrowing the church of Dr.
Stillingfleet, Dean of St. Paul's, the present incumbent. We afterward
dined at a house in Holborn; and, after the solemnity and dancing was
done, they were bedded at Sir John Stonehouse's lodgings in Bow Street,
Convent Garden.

26th February, 1680. To the Royal Society, where I met an Irish Bishop
with his Lady, who was daughter to my worthy and pious friend, Dr.
Jeremy Taylor, late Bishop of Down and Connor; they came to see the
Repository. She seemed to be a knowing woman, beyond the ordinary talent
of her sex.

3d March, 1680. I dined at my Lord Mayor's, in order to the meeting of
my Lady Beckford, whose daughter (a rich heiress) I had recommended to
my brother of Wotton for his only son, she being the daughter of the
lady by Mr. Eversfield, a Sussex gentleman.

16th March, 1680. To London, to receive £3,000 of my daughter-in-law's
portion, which was paid in gold.

26th March, 1680. The Dean of Sarum preached on Jerem. xlv. 5, an hour
and a half from his common-place book, of kings and great men retiring
to private situations. Scarce anything of Scripture in it.

[Sidenote: CASHIOBURY]

18th April, 1680. On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went
with him to his house at Cashiobury, in Hertfordshire. It was on Sunday,
but going early from his house in the square of St. James, we arrived by
ten o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church, and we had
prayers in his chapel. The house is new, a plain fabric, built by my
friend, Mr. Hugh May. There are divers fair and good rooms, and
excellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of the
library. There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio, of
Apollo and the Liberal Arts. One room pargeted with yew, which I liked
well. Some of the chimney mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my
Lord from Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much inferior to
Italian. The tympanum, or gable, at the front is a bass-relievo of Diana
hunting, cut in Portland stone, handsomely enough. I do not approve of
the middle doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as
designed, it being an oval with a cupola, together with the other wing,
it will be a very noble palace. The library is large, and very nobly
furnished, and all the books are richly bound and gilded; but there are
no MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the transcribing and
binding of which cost him, as he assured me, £500.

No man has been more industrious than this noble Lord in planting about
his seat, adorned with walks, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the
soil is stony, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the
house, though a very swift and clear stream runs within a flight-shot
from it in the valley, which may fitly be called Coldbrook, it being
indeed excessively cold, yet producing fair trouts. It is a pity the
house was not situated to more advantage: but it seems it was built just
where the old one was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this
leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a little.

The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but the coldness of the
place hinders the growth. Black cherry trees prosper even to
considerable timber, some being eighty feet long; they make also very
handsome avenues. There is a pretty oval at the end of a fair walk, set
about with treble rows of Spanish chestnut trees.

The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skillful
an artist to govern them as Mr. Cooke, who is, as to the mechanic part,
not ignorant in mathematics, and pretends to astrology. There is an
excellent collection of the choicest fruit.

As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and pondering person,
not illiterate beyond the rate of most noblemen in this age, very well
versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical,
and every way accomplished. His Lady (being sister of the late Earl of
Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy woman, setting her
heart too much on the little lady, her daughter, of whom she is over
fond. They have a hopeful son at the Academy.

My Lord was not long since come from his Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland,
where he showed his abilities in administration and government, as well
as prudence in considerably augmenting his estate without reproach. He
had been Ambassador-extraordinary in Denmark, and, in a word, such a
person as became the son of that worthy hero his father to be, the late
Lord Capel, who lost his life for King Charles I.

We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding, and contriving
[alterations], and the afternoons in the library, so as I passed my time
for three or four days with much satisfaction. He was pleased in
conversation to impart to me divers particulars of state, relating to
the present times. He being no great friend to the D---- was now laid
aside, his integrity and abilities being not so suitable in this
conjuncture. 21st. I returned to London.

30th April, 1680. To a meeting of the executors of late Viscountess
Mordaunt's estate, to consider of the sale of Parson's Green, being in
treaty with Mr. Loftus, and to settle the half year's account.

1st May, 1680. Was a meeting of the feoffees of the poor of our parish.
This year I would stand one of the collectors of their rents, to give
example to others. My son was added to the feoffees.

This afternoon came to visit me Sir Edward Deering, of Surrendon, in
Kent, one of the Lords of the Treasury, with his daughter, married to my
worthy friend, Sir Robert Southwell, Clerk of the Council, now
Extraordinary-Envoy to the Duke of Brandenburgh, and other Princes in
Germany, as before he had been in Portugal, being a sober, wise, and
virtuous gentleman.

13th May, 1680. I was at the funeral of old Mr. Shish, master-shipwright
of his Majesty's Yard here, an honest and remarkable man, and his death
a public loss, for his excellent success in building ships (though
altogether illiterate), and for breeding up so many of his children to
be able artists. I held up the pall with three knights, who did him that
honor, and he was worthy of it. It was the custom of this good man to
rise in the night, and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had
lying by him for many years. He was born that famous year, the
Gunpowder-plot, 1605.

14th June, 1680. Came to dine with us the Countess of Clarendon, Dr.
Lloyd, Dean of Bangor (since Bishop of St. Asaph), Dr. Burnet, author of
the "History of the Reformation," and my old friend, Mr. Henshaw. After
dinner we all went to see the Observatory, and Mr. Flamsted, who showed
us divers rare instruments, especially the great quadrant.

[Sidenote: WINDSOR]

24th July, 1680. Went with my wife and daughter to Windsor, to see that
stately court, now near finished. There was erected in the court the
King on horseback, lately cast in copper, and set on a rich pedestal of
white marble, the work of Mr. Gibbons, at the expense of Toby Rustate, a
page of the back stairs, who by his wonderful frugality had arrived to a
great estate in money, and did many works of charity, as well as this of
gratitude to his master, which cost him £1,000. He is very simple,
ignorant, but honest and loyal creature.

We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterward to see Signor
Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College, to salute the provost, and
heard a Latin speech of one of the alumni (it being at the election) and
were invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London that night
in good time.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th July, 1680. My most noble and illustrious friend, the Earl of
Ossory, espying me this morning after sermon in the privy gallery,
calling to me, told me he was now going his journey (meaning to Tangier,
whither he was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to regain
the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors, when Inchiquin was
Governor). I asked if he would not call at my house (as he always did
whenever he went out of England on any exploit). He said he must embark
at Portsmouth, "wherefore let you and me dine together to-day; I am
quite alone, and have something to impart to you; I am not well, shall
be private, and desire your company."

Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch, he sent to his
secretary for the copy of a letter which he had written to Lord
Sunderland (Secretary of State), wishing me to read it; it was to take
notice how ill he resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord
Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would certainly be
lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord Ossory should be sent, that
they might give some account of it to the world, meaning (as supposed)
the next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably be
examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord Sunderland, and not
kindly of the King, who resolving to send him with an incompetent force,
seemed, as his Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not
only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion, an
impossibility, seeing there was not to be above 300 or 400 horse, and
4,000 foot for the garrison and all, both to defend the town, form a
camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify what ground they should get in.
This touched my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered as
to put him on a business in which he should probably not only lose his
reputation, but be charged with all the miscarriage and ill success;
whereas, at first they promised 6,000 foot and 600 horse effective.

My Lord, being an exceedingly brave and valiant person, and who had so
approved himself in divers signal battles, both at sea and land; so
beloved and so esteemed by the people, as one they depended on, upon all
occasions worthy of such a captain;--he looked on this as too great an
indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the merits of
his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design of some who envied his
virtue. It certainly took so deep root in his mind, that he who was the
most void of fear in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier
with ten men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear up against
this unkindness. Having disburdened himself of this to me after dinner,
he went with his Majesty to the sheriffs at a great supper in
Fishmongers' Hall; but finding himself ill, took his leave immediately
of his Majesty, and came back to his lodging. Not resting well this
night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington House, for better
accommodation. His disorder turned to a malignant fever, which
increasing, after all that six of the most able physicians could do, he
became delirious, with intervals of sense, during which Dr. Lloyd (after
Bishop of St. Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament, of which I also
participated. He died the Friday following, the 30th of July, to the
universal grief of all that knew or heard of his great worth, nor had
any a greater loss than myself. Oft would he say I was the oldest
acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in Ireland), it
being now of about thirty years, contracted abroad, when he rode in the
Academy in Paris, and when we were seldom asunder.

His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a better or more
dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured, and perfectly obliging
friend; one who had done innumerable kindnesses to several before they
knew it; nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no one more
brave, more modest; none more humble, sober, and every way virtuous.
Unhappy England in this illustrious person's loss! Universal was the
mourning for him, and the eulogies on him; I stayed night and day by his
bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes! O sad father, mother,
wife, and children! What shall I add? He deserved all that a sincere
friend, a brave soldier, a virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest
man, a bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his prince
and country. One thing more let me note, that he often expressed to me
the abhorrence he had of that base and unworthy action which he was put
upon, of engaging the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though he
behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me it was the only
blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly. Though he was commanded,
and never examined further when he was so, yet he always spoke of it
with regret and detestation. The Countess was at the seat of her
daughter, the Countess of Derby, about 200 miles off.

30th August, 1680. I went to visit a French gentleman, one Monsieur
Chardin, who having been thrice in the East Indies, Persia, and other
remote countries, came hither in our return ships from those parts, and
it being reported that he was a very curious and knowing man, I was
desired by the Royal Society to salute him in their name, and to invite
him to honor them with his company. Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir
Christopher Wren accompanied me. We found him at his lodgings in his
eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable, a modest,
well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders. He spoke Latin, and
understood Greek, Arabic, and Persian, from eleven years' travels in
those parts, whither he went in search of jewels, and was become very
rich. He seemed about 36 years of age. After the usual civilities, we
asked some account of the extraordinary things he must have seen in
traveling over land to those places where few, if any, northern
Europeans used to go, as the Black and Caspian Sea, Mingrelia, Bagdad,
Nineveh, Persepolis, etc. He told us that the things most worthy of our
sight would be, the draughts he had caused to be made of some noble
ruins, etc.; for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had
carried two good painters with him, to draw landscapes, measure and
design the remains of the palace which Alexander burned in his frolic at
Persepolis, with divers temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet
extant, which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything he had
observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any other part of the world
where magnificence was in estimation. He said there was an inscription
in letters not intelligible, though entire. He was sorry he could not
gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his things not being
yet out of the ship; but would wait on them with them on his return from
Paris, whither he was going the next day, but with intention to return
suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in France not suffering
Protestants, and he was one, to be quiet.

He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried in her ruins,
the inhabitants building on the subterranean vaults, which were, as
appeared, the first stories of the old city, that there were frequently
found huge vases of fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the
straw which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not to burn,
or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being chopped small to mingle
with the clay, which being dried in the sun (for they bake not in the
furnace) would else cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of
Ignicolæ, who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women of
Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and without any compare, the
most beautiful creatures for shape, features, and figure, in the world,
and therefore the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence most of
their wives and concubines; that there had within these hundred years
been Amazons among them, that is to say, a sort or race of valiant
women, given to war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of
Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our late geographers,
as we suggested matter for discourse. We then took our leave, failing of
seeing his papers; but it was told us by others that indeed he dared not
open, or show them, till he had first showed them to the French King;
but of this he himself said nothing.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d September, 1680. I had an opportunity, his Majesty being still at
Windsor, of seeing his private library at Whitehall, at my full ease. I
went with expectation of finding some curiosities, but, though there
were about 1,000 volumes, there were few of importance which I had not
perused before. They consisted chiefly of such books as had from time to
time been dedicated, or presented to him; a few histories, some Travels
and French books, abundance of maps and sea charts, entertainments and
pomps, buildings and pieces relating to the navy, some mathematical
instruments; but what was most rare, were three or four Romish
breviaries, with a great deal of miniature and monkish painting and
gilding, one of which is most exquisitely done, both as to the figures,
grotesques, and compartments, to the utmost of that curious art. There
is another in which I find written by the hand of King Henry VII., his
giving it to his dear daughter, Margaret, afterward Queen of Scots, in
which he desires her to pray for his soul, subscribing his name at
length. There is also the process of the philosophers' great elixir,
represented in divers pieces of excellent miniature, but the discourse
is in high Dutch, a MS. There is another MS. in quarto, of above 300
years old, in French, being an institution of physic, and in the
botanical part the plants are curiously painted in miniature; also a
folio MS. of good thickness, being the several exercises, as Themes,
Orations, Translations, etc., of King Edward VI., all written and
subscribed by his own hand, and with his name very legible, and divers
of the Greek interleaved and corrected after the manner of schoolboys'
exercises, and that exceedingly well and proper; with some epistles to
his preceptor, which show that young prince to have been extraordinarily
advanced in learning, and as Cardan, who had been in England affirmed,
stupendously knowing for his age. There is likewise his journal, no less
testifying his early ripeness and care about the affairs of state.

There are besides many pompous volumes, some embossed with gold, and
intaglios on agates, medals, etc. I spent three or four entire days,
locked up, and alone, among these books and curiosities. In the rest of
the private lodgings contiguous to this, are divers of the best pictures
of the great masters, Raphael, Titian, etc., and in my esteem, above
all, the "_Noli me tangere_" of our blessed Savior to Mary Magdalen
after his Resurrection, of Hans Holbein; than which I never saw so much
reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture.

There are also divers curious clocks, watches, and pendules of exquisite
work, and other curiosities. An ancient woman who made these lodgings
clean, and had all the keys, let me in at pleasure for a small reward,
by means of a friend.

6th September, 1680. I dined with Sir Stephen Fox, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury. This gentleman came first a poor boy from
the choir of Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa, and
afterward waited on my Lord Percy (brother to Algernon, Earl of
Northumberland), who procured for him an inferior place among the clerks
of the kitchen and Greencloth side, where he was found so humble,
diligent, industrious, and prudent in his behavior, that his Majesty
being in exile, and Mr. Fox waiting, both the King and Lords about him
frequently employed him about their affairs, and trusted him both with
receiving and paying the little money they had. Returning with his
Majesty to England, after great want and great sufferings, his Majesty
found him so honest and industrious, and withal so capable and ready,
that, being advanced from clerk of the kitchen to that of the
Greencloth, he procured to be paymaster of the whole army, and by his
dexterity and punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the
bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast sums of them
upon any exigence. The continual turning thus of money, and the
soldiers' moderate allowance to him for keeping touch with them, did so
enrich him, that he is believed to be worth at least £200,000, honestly
got and unenvied; which is next to a miracle. With all this he continues
as humble and ready to do a courtesy as ever he was.

He is generous, and lives very honorably, of a sweet nature,
well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his Majesty's esteem, and so
useful, that being long since made a knight, he is also advanced to be
one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion of
the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker. He has married his eldest
daughter to my Lord Cornwallis, and gave her £12,000, and restored that
entangled family besides. He matched his son to Mrs. Trollop, who brings
with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether, £2,000 per
annum. Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent woman) is sister to Mr. Whittle,
one of the King's chirurgeons. In a word, never was man more fortunate
than Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very religious.

23d September, 1680. Came to my house some German strangers and Signor
Pietro, a famous musician, who had been long in Sweden in Queen
Christina's Court; he sung admirably to a guitar, and had a perfect good
tenor and bass, and had set to Italian composure many of Abraham
Cowley's pieces which showed extremely well. He told me that in Sweden
the heat in some part of summer was as excessive as the cold in winter;
so cold, he affirmed, that the streets of all the towns are desolate, no
creatures stirring in them for many months, all the inhabitants retiring
to their stoves. He spoke high things of that romantic Queen's learning
and skill in languages, the majesty of her behavior, her exceeding wit,
and that the histories she had read of other countries, especially of
Italy and Rome, had made her despise her own. That the real occasion of
her resigning her crown was the nobleman's importuning her to marry, and
the promise which the Pope had made her of procuring her to be Queen of
Naples, which also caused her to change her religion; but she was
cheated by his crafty Holiness,[43] working on her ambition; that the
reason of her killing her secretary at Fontainebleau, was, his revealing
that intrigue with the Pope. But, after all this, I rather believe it
was her mad prodigality and extreme vanity, which had consumed those
vast treasures the great Adolphus, her father, had brought out of
Germany during his [campaigns] there and wonderful successes; and that,
if she had not voluntarily resigned, as foreseeing the event, the
Estates of her kingdom would have compelled her to do so.

    Sienna.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1680. I went to London to be private, my birthday being
the next day, and I now arrived at my sixtieth year; on which I began a
more solemn survey of my whole life, in order to the making and
confirming my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of all my actions
past, as far as I was able to call them to mind. How difficult and
uncertain, yet how necessary a work! The Lord be merciful to me, and
accept me! Who can tell how oft he offendeth? Teach me, therefore, so to
number my days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom, and make my
calling and election sure. Amen, Lord Jesus!

31st October, 1680. I spent this whole day in exercises. A stranger
preached at Whitehall[44] on Luke xvi. 30, 31. I then went to St.
Martin's, where the Bishop of St. Asaph preached on 1 Peter iii. 15; the
Holy Communion followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring God's
assistance in the great work I was entering into. In the afternoon, I
heard Dr. Sprat, at St. Margaret's, on Acts xvii. 11.

    [Footnote 44: Probably to the King's household, very early in the
    morning, as the custom was.]

I began and spent the whole week in examining my life, begging pardon
for my faults, assistance and blessing for the future, that I might, in
some sort, be prepared for the time that now drew near, and not have the
great work to begin, when one can work no longer. The Lord Jesus help
and assist me! I therefore stirred little abroad till the 5th of
November, when I heard Dr. Tenison, the now vicar of St. Martin's; Dr.
Lloyd, the former incumbent, being made Bishop of St. Asaph.

7th November, 1680. I participated of the blessed Communion, finishing
and confirming my resolutions of giving myself up more entirely to God,
to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder
of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable
servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his infinite goodness and
mercy accepting my endeavors.

15th November, 1680. Came to dine with us Sir Richard Anderson, his
lady, son and wife, sister to my daughter-in-law.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th November, 1680. The anniversary election at the Royal Society
brought me to London, where was chosen President that excellent person
and great philosopher, Mr. Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been
the very first; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty could now any
longer excuse him. I desired I might for this year be left out of the
Council, by reason my dwelling was in the country. The Society according
to custom dined together.

The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present) of my Lord
Viscount Stafford, (for conspiring the death of the King), second son to
my Lord Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of
England, and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom I so well
knew, and from which excellent person I received so many favors. It was
likewise his birthday, The trial was in Westminster Hall, before the
King, Lords, and Commons, just in the same manner as, forty years past,
the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there being but one letter
differing their names) received his trial for pretended ill government
in Ireland, in the very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being
then High Steward. The place of sitting was now exalted some
considerable height from the paved floor of the hall, with a stage of
boards. The throne, woolsacks for the Judges, long forms for the Peers,
chair for the Lord Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords.
The sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the members of
the House of Commons. At the upper end, and on the right side of the
King's state, was a box for his Majesty, and on the left others for the
great ladies, and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public
ministers. At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place for the
prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, the ax-bearer and
guards, my Lord Stafford's two daughters, the Marchioness of Winchester
being one; there was likewise a box for my Lord to retire into. At the
right hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses; at the
left, the managers, in the name of the Commons of England, namely,
Serjeant Maynard (the great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause
against the Earl of Strafford forty years before, being now near eighty
years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General, Sir Francis
Winnington, a famous pleader, and Mr. Treby, now Recorder of London, not
appearing in their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords, as
representing the Commons of England: to these were joined Mr. Hampden,
Dr. Sacheverell, Mr. Poule, Colonel Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen
of quality, and noted parliamentary men. The first two days, in which
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a tedious entrance
into matter of fact, at which I was but little present. But, on
Thursday, I was commodiously seated among the Commons, when the
witnesses were sworn and examined. The principal witnesses were Mr.
Oates (who called himself Dr.), Mr. Dugdale, and Turberville. Oates
swore that he delivered a commission to Viscount Stafford from the Pope,
to be Paymaster-General to an army intended to be raised; Dugdale, that
being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly to murder his
Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he also proposed the same to
him.

3d December, 1680. The depositions of my Lord's witnesses were taken, to
invalidate the King's witnesses; they were very slight persons, but,
being fifteen or sixteen, they took up all that day, and in truth they
rather did my Lord more injury than service.

4th December, 1680. Came other witnesses of the Commons to corroborate
the King's, some being Peers, some Commons, with others of good quality,
who took off all the former day's objections, and set the King's
witnesses _recti in curiâ_.

6th December, 1680. Sir William Jones summed up the evidence; to him
succeeded all the rest of the managers, and then Mr. Henry Poule made a
vehement oration. After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often
during the trial, spoke in his own defense, denying the charge
altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville, at the
time and manner affirmed: in truth, their testimony did little weigh
with me; Dugdale's only seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spoke
a great while, but confusedly, without any method.

One thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess did exceedingly
affect me: That a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly
brag that though he went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a
Papist, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed to apostatize
from the Protestant, but only as a spy; though he confessed he took
their sacrament; worshiped images, went through all their oaths and
discipline of their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but
with intent to come over again and betray them; that such a hypocrite,
that had so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we of
the Church of England termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was
entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and consequently (as he
pretended) trusted; I say, that the witness of such a profligate wretch
should be admitted against the life of a peer,--this my Lord looked upon
as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to the dishonor of
our religion and nation. And verily I am of his Lordship's opinion: such
a man's testimony should not be taken against the life of a dog. But the
merit of something material which he discovered against Coleman, put him
in such esteem with the Parliament, that now, I fancy, he stuck at
nothing, and thought everybody was to take what he said for Gospel. The
consideration of this, and some other circumstances, began to stagger
me; particularly how it was possible that one who went among the Papists
on such a design, and pretended to be intrusted with so many letters and
commissions from the Pope and the party,--nay, and delivered them to so
many great persons,--should not reserve one of them to show, nor so much
as one copy of any commission, which he who had such dexterity in
opening letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction
of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained credit on Coleman.
But, as to others whom he so madly flew upon, I am little inclined to
believe his testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill
bred, and of such impudent behavior; nor is it likely that such piercing
politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so high and so
dangerous secrets.

7th December, 1680. On Tuesday, I was again at the trial, when judgment
was demanded; and, after my Lord had spoken what he could in denying the
fact, the managers answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to
their House, and within two hours returned again. There was, in the
meantime, this question put to the judges, "whether there being but one
witness to any single crime, or act, it could amount to convict a man of
treason." They gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they
all were overt acts for though no man should be condemned by one witness
for any one act, yet for several acts to the same intent, it was valid;
which was my Lord's case. This being past, and the Peers in their seats
again, the Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward)
removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after summoning the
Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth his prisoner, and proclamation
made for silence, demanded of every Peer (who were in all eighty-six)
whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of the treason laid
to his charge, or not guilty.

Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his right hand upon his
breast, said guilty, or not guilty, upon my honor, and then sat down,
the Lord Steward noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper:
when all had done, the number of not guilty being but 31, the guilty 55;
and then, after proclamation for silence again, the Lord Steward
directing his speech to the prisoner, against whom the ax was turned
edgeways and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being ennobled
by the King's father, and since received many favors from his present
Majesty: after enlarging on his offense, deploring first his own
unhappiness that he who had never condemned any man before should now be
necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence of death by
hanging, drawing, and quartering, according to form, with great
solemnity and dreadful gravity; and, after a short pause, told the
prisoner that he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission of
some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only excepted; and then
breaking his white staff, the Court was dissolved. My Lord Stafford
during all this latter part spoke but little, and only gave their
Lordships thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed behaved
himself modestly, and as became him.

It was observed that all his own relations of his name and family
condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl of Arundel, son to the Duke
of Norfolk. And it must be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried
on with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance I had
never seen before; for, besides the innumerable spectators of gentlemen
and foreign ministers, who saw and heard all the proceedings, the
prisoner had the consciences of all the Commons of England for his
accusers, and all the Peers to be his judges and jury. He had likewise
the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct him in his plea, who
stood by him. And yet I can hardly think that a person of his age and
experience should engage men whom he never saw before (and one of them
that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) POINT BLANK to murder the
King: God only, who searches hearts, can discover the truth. Lord
Stafford was not a man beloved especially of his own family.

12th December, 1680. This evening, looking out of my chamber window
toward the west, I saw a meteor of an obscure bright color, very much in
shape like the blade of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and
clear. What this may portend, God only knows; but such another
phenomenon I remember to have seen in 1640, about the trial of the great
Earl of Strafford, preceding our bloody Rebellion. I pray God avert his
judgments! We have had of late several comets, which though I believe
appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate not, yet I cannot
despise them. They may be warnings from God, as they commonly are
forerunners of his animadversions. After many days and nights of snow,
cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.

17th December, 1680. My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a son,
christened Richard.

22d December, 1680. A solemn public Fast that God would prevent all
Popish plots, avert his judgments, and give a blessing to the
proceedings of Parliament now assembled, and which struck at the
succession of the Duke of York.

29th December, 1680. The Viscount Stafford was beheaded on Towerhill.

10th February, 1680-81. I was at the wedding of my nephew, John Evelyn
of Wotton, married by the Bishop of Rochester at Westminster, in Henry
VII.'s chapel, to the daughter and heir of Mr. Eversfield, of Sussex,
her portion £8,000. The solemnity was kept with a few friends only at
Lady Beckford's, the lady's mother.

8th March, 1681. Visited and dined at the Earl of Essex's, with whom I
spent most of the afternoon alone. Thence to my (yet living) godmother
and kinswoman, Mrs. Keightley, sister to Sir Thomas Evelyn and niece to
my father, being now eighty-six years of age, sprightly, and in perfect
health, her eyes serving her as well as ever, and of a comely
countenance, that one would not suppose her above fifty.

27th March, 1681. The Parliament now convened at Oxford. Great
expectation of his Royal Highness's case as to the succession, against
which the House was set.

An extraordinary sharp, cold spring, not yet a leaf on the trees, frost
and snow lying: while the whole nation was in the greatest ferment.

11th April, 1681. I took my leave of Dr. Lloyd (Bishop of St. Asaph) at
his house in Leicester Fields, now going to reside in his diocese.

12th April, 1681. I dined at Mr. Brisbane's, Secretary to the Admiralty,
a learned and industrious person, whither came Dr. Burnet, to thank me
for some papers I had contributed toward his excellent "History of the
Reformation."

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1681. I dined at Don Pietro Ronquillo's, the Spanish
Ambassador, at Wild House, who used me with extraordinary civility. The
dinner was plentiful, half after the Spanish, half after the English
way. After dinner, he led me into his bedchamber, where we fell into a
long discourse concerning religion. Though he was a learned man in
politics, and an advocate, he was very ignorant in religion, and unable
to defend any point of controversy; he was, however, far from being
fierce. At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the
blessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who
had been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully
enlightened and convinced by her intercession. He importuned me to come
and visit him often.

29th April, 1681. But one shower of rain all this month.

5th May, 1681. Came to dine with me Sir William Fermor, of
Northamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren, his Majesty's architect and
surveyor, now building the Cathedral of St. Paul, and the column in
memory of the city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of
fifty parish churches. A wonderful genius had this incomparable person.

16th May, 1681. Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire that I would propose
a match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs.
Jane, Sir Stephen's daughter. I excused myself all I was able; for the
truth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a
youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render
him a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me
apprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like
a friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to
receive a large share of her father's opulence. Lord Sunderland was much
sunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no
longer Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King
for siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am
assured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the
preservation of the Protestant religion, but by mistaking the ability of
the party to carry it. However, so earnest and importunate was the
Countess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too
great an honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my Lord,
and he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual
liking; with other objections which I neither would or could contradict.
He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the
honor done him, that his daughter and her son were too young, that he
would do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable
of expressing judiciously, till she was sixteen or seventeen years of
age, of which she now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as
civilly as I could.

20th May, 1681. Our new curate preached, a pretty hopeful young man, yet
somewhat raw, newly come from college, full of Latin sentences, which in
time will wear off. He read prayers very well.

25th May, 1681. There came to visit me Sir William Walter and Sir John
Elowes: and the next day, the Earl of Kildare, a young gentleman related
to my wife, and other company. There had scarce fallen any rain since
Christmas.

2d June, 1681. I went to Hampton Court, when the Surrey gentlemen
presented their addresses to his Majesty, whose hand I kissed,
introduced by the Duke of Albemarle. Being at the Privy Council, I took
another occasion of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his daughter
and to revive that business, and at least brought it to this: That in
case the young people liked one the other, after four years, he first
desiring to see a particular of my Lord's present estate if I could
transmit it to him privately, he would make her portion £14,000, though
to all appearance he might likely make it £50,000 as easily, his eldest
son having no child and growing very corpulent.

12th June, 1681. It still continued so great a drought as had never been
known in England, and it was said to be universal.

14th August, 1681. No sermon this afternoon, which I think did not
happen twice in this parish these thirty years; so gracious has God been
to it, and indeed to the whole nation: God grant that we abuse not this
great privilege either by our wantonness, schism, or unfaithfulness,
under such means as he has not favored any other nation under Heaven
besides!

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

23d August, 1681. I went to Wotton, and, on the following day, was
invited to Mr. Denzil Onslow's at his seat at Purford, where was much
company, and such an extraordinary feast, as I had hardly seen at any
country gentleman's table. What made it more remarkable was, that there
was not anything save what his estate about it did afford; as venison,
rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all
sorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts
of fresh fish. After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy, where I
never saw so many herons.

The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and
exceedingly improved since Mr. Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst,
who spent a fair estate. The house is timber, but commodious, and with
one ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings of fowl and
huntings, etc., the work of Mr. Barlow, who is excellent in this kind
from the life.

30th August, 1681. From Wotton I went to see Mr. Hussey (at Sutton in
Shere), who has a very pretty seat well watered, near my brother's. He
is the neatest husband for curious ordering his domestic and field
accommodations, and what pertains to husbandry, that I have ever seen,
as to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils, plows, carts,
stables, wood piles, wood houses, even to hen roosts and hog troughs.
Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in
exact order. The sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity
of sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his canals and
receptacles for fish too soon. The rest of my time of stay at Wotton was
spent in walking about the grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my
youth so often entertained my solitude; and so, on the 2d of September,
I once more returned to my home.

6th September, 1681. Died my pretty grandchild, and was interred on the
8th [at Deptford].

14th September, 1681. Dined with Sir Stephen Fox, who proposed to me the
purchasing of Chelsea College, which his Majesty had sometime since
given to our Society, and would now purchase it again to build a
hospital; or infirmary for soldiers there, in which he desired my
assistance as one of the Council of the Royal Society.

15th September, 1681. I had another opportunity of visiting his
Majesty's private library at Whitehall.

To Sir Samuel Morland's, to see his house and mechanics.

17th September, 1681. I went with Monsieur Faubert about taking the
Countess of Bristol's house for an academy, he being lately come from
Paris for his religion, and resolving to settle here.

23d September, 1681. I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's fine house and
garden at Peckham.

2d October, 1681. I went to Camberwell, where that good man Dr. Parr
(late chaplain to Archbishop Usher) preached on Acts xvi. 30.

11th October, 1681. To Fulham, to visit the Bishop of London, in whose
garden I first saw the _Sedum arborescens_ in flower, which was
exceedingly beautiful.

5th November, 1681. Dr. Hooper preached on Mark xii. 16, 17, before the
King, of the usurpation of the Church of Rome. This is one of the first
rank of pulpit men in the nation.

15th November, 1681. I dined with the Earl of Essex who, after dinner
in his study, where we were alone, related to me how much he had been
scandalized and injured in the report of his being privy to the marriage
of his Lady's niece, the rich young widow of the late Lord Ogle, sole
daughter of the Earl of Northumberland; showing me a letter of Mr.
Thynn's, excusing himself for not communicating his marriage to his
Lordship. He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate
lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland,
and Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of
the Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular
of the jointure which Mr. Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady,
yet he totally discouraged the proceeding as by no means a competent
match for one that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the
greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed the Earl of
Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but was by no means for Mr. Thynn.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th November, 1681. I dined with my worthy friend, Mr. Erskine, Master
of the Charter House, uncle to the Duchess of Monmouth; a wise and
learned gentleman, fitter to have been a privy councillor and minister
of state than to have been laid aside.

24th November, 1681. I was at the audience of the Russian Ambassador
before both their Majesties in the Banqueting House. The presents were
carried before him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the
King's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of which was
doubtlessly brought from France as being of that fabric, the Ambassador
having passed through that kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large
Persian carpet, furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so
splendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon after the King's
restoration. This present Ambassador was exceedingly offended that his
coach was not permitted to come into the Court, till, being told that no
King's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring an attestation of
it under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell, the Master of the
Ceremonies; being, it seems, afraid he should offend his Master, if he
omitted the least punctilio. It was reported he condemned his son to
lose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting himself in the
French mode at Paris, and that he would have executed it, had not the
French King interceded--but qy. of this.

30th November, 1681. Sir Christopher Wren chosen President [of the Royal
Society], Mr. Austine, Secretary, with Dr. Plot, the ingenious author of
the "History of Oxfordshire." There was a most illustrious appearance.

11th January, 1681-82. I saw the audience of the Morocco Ambassador,
his retinue not numerous. He was received in the Banqueting House, both
their Majesties being present. He came up to the throne without making
any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body. He spoke by a
renegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise. They
were all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of colored cloth, or silk,
with buttons and loops, over this an _alhaga_, or white woolen mantle,
so large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban,
naked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich
scymetar, and large calico sleeved shirts. The Ambassador had a string
of pearls oddly woven in his turban. I fancy the old Roman habit was
little different as to the mantle and naked limbs. He was a handsome
person, well featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil.
Their presents were lions and ostriches; their errand about a peace at
Tangier. But the concourse and tumult of the people was intolerable, so
as the officers could keep no order, which these strangers were
astonished at first, there being nothing so regular, exact, and
performed with such silence, as is on all these public occasions of
their country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.

14th January, 1682. Dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, at the Abbey, it
being his marriage day, after twenty-four years. He related to me how he
had been treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might be a
delegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now likely come in controversy
upon her marriage with Mr. Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of
Danby, Lord Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and sincere
advice he gave him from time to time about his miscarriages and
partialities; particularly his outing Sir John Duncomb from being
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being
Paymaster of the Army. The Treasurer's excuse and reason was, that Fox's
credit was so over great with the bankers and monied men, that he could
procure none but by his means, "for that reason," replied the Bishop, "I
would have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest
and of credit." He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty
of access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him
hated.

24th January, 1682. To the Royal Society, where at the Council we
passed a new law for the more accurate consideration of candidates, as
whether they would really be useful; also concerning the honorary
members, that none should be admitted but by diploma.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

This evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the
Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a
great banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador
and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and
modesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between two Moors, and
among these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and
Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, etc., concubines, and cattle
of that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make
them; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,
furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of
the banquet. They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine;
they also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;[45] did not look about, or
stare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly
negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior, answering only to
such questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and
so gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the
Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son meaning the little Duke of
Richmond. The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was
going away. In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home)
entertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park
on horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extraordinary
activity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full
speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed,
managing their spears with incredible agility. He went sometimes to the
theaters, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not
forbear laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary
modesty and gravity. In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court
behaved himself like a clown compared to this civil heathen.

    [Footnote 45: Sherbet and chocolate.]

27th January, 1682. This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again
with his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal
Hospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal
Society had sold to his Majesty for £1,300, and that he would settle
£5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of £20,000 for the relief
and reception of four companies, namely, 400 men, to be as in a college,
or monastery. I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only
the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a
grand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate
by the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in,
as to the government. So, in his study we arranged the governor,
chaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener,
porter, and other officers, with their several salaries and
entertainments. I would needs have a library, and mentioned several
books, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at
leisure to recollect. Thus we made the first calculations, and set down
our thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty
and the Archbishop. He also engaged me to consider of what laws and
orders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as
strict as in any religious convent.

After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr. Abel, newly returned from
Italy; I never heard a more excellent voice; one would have sworn it had
been a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed,
being accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.

28th January, 1682. Mr. Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, showed
me a large folio containing the whole mechanic part and art of building
royal ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate
a piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns, victualing,
manning, and even to every individual pin and nail, in a method so
astonishing and curious, with a draught, both geometrical and in
perspective, and several sections, that I do not think the world can
show the like. I esteem this book as an extraordinary jewel.

7th February, 1682. My daughter, Mary, began to learn music of Signor
Bartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur Isaac, reputed the best masters.

Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing
my legs in milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it: and
sitting so in it in a deep churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and
drinking _carduus_ posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not only
missed that expected fit, but had no more, only continued weak, that I
could not go to church till Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I
think, so long in twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.

After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and
methodize all my writings, accounts, letters, papers; inventoried the
goods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best
order I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might
have none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it
should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life. With
this, I prepared some special meditations and devotions for the time of
sickness. The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for my poor soul in
that day, that I may obtain mercy and acceptance!

1st March, 1682. My second grandchild was born, and christened the next
day by our vicar at Sayes Court, by the name of John.[46] I beseech God
to bless him!

    [Footnote 46: Who became his successor, and was created a baronet in
    1713.]

2d March, 1682. ASH WEDNESDAY. I went to church: our vicar preached on
Proverbs, showing what care and vigilance was required for the keeping
of the heart upright. The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave God
thanks for his gracious dealing with me in my late sickness, and
affording me this blessed opportunity of praising him in the
congregation, and receiving the cup of salvation with new and serious
resolutions.

Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John Lowther, Mr. Herbert,
Mr. Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane, and Mr. Hill.

10th March, 1682. This day was executed Colonel Vrats, and some of his
accomplices, for the execrable murder of Mr. Thynn, set on by the
principal Koningsmark. He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as
one that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count
Koningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and
was acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got away. Vrats told a friend of
mine who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice that
he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal
with him like a gentleman. Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad
fate.

24th March, 1682. I went to see the corpse of that obstinate creature,
Colonel Vrats, the King permitting that his body should be transported
to his own country, he being of a good family, and one of the first
embalmed by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a
coffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling, or to
appearance using any bituminous matter. The flesh was florid, soft, and
full, as if the person were only sleeping. He had now been dead near
fifteen days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined with lead, too
magnificent for so daring and horrid a murderer.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

At the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited some pieces of amber
sent by the Duke of Brandenburg, in one of which was a spider, in
another a gnat, both very entire. There was a discourse of the tingeing
of glass, especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red
color effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters; that the
most diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc., did not enter into the substance
of what was ordinarily painted, more than very shallow, unless
incorporated in the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all
beyond the superfices.

5th April, 1682. To the Royal Society, where at a Council was regulated
what collections should be published monthly, as formerly the
transactions, which had of late been discontinued, but were now much
called for by the curious abroad and at home.

12th April, 1682. I went this afternoon with several of the Royal
Society to a supper which was all dressed, both fish and flesh, in
Monsieur Papin's digestors, by which the hardest bones of beef itself,
and mutton, were made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,
and with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an incredible
quantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly made of the bones of
beef, the best for clearness and good relish, and the most delicious
that I had ever seen, or tasted. We ate pike and other fish, bones and
all, without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons, which tasted
just as if baked in a pie, all these being stewed in their own juice,
without any addition of water save what swam about the digestor, as _in
balneo_; the natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser
substances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but it is best
descanted with more particulars for extracting tinctures, preserving and
stewing fruit, and saving fuel, in Dr. Papin's book, published and
dedicated to our Society of which he is a member. He is since gone to
Venice with the late Resident here (and also a member of our Society),
who carried this excellent mechanic, philosopher, and physician, to set
up a philosophical meeting in that city. This philosophical supper
caused much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the company. I
sent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the reproach of all that the
ladies ever made of their best hartshorn.[47]

    [Footnote 47: Denys Papin, a French physician and mathematician, who
    possessed so remarkable a knowledge of mathematics, that he very
    nearly brought the invention of the steam engine into working order.
    He assisted Mr. Boyle in his pneumatic experiments, and was
    afterward mathematical professor at Marburg. He died in 1710.]

The season was unusually wet, with rain and thunder.

25th May, 1682. I was desired by Sir Stephen Fox and Sir Christopher
Wren to accompany them to Lambeth, with the plot and design of the
college to be built at Chelsea, to have the Archbishop's approbation. It
was a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of the larger
quadrangle at Christ church, Oxford, for the accommodation of 440
persons, with governor and officers. This was agreed on.

The Duke and Duchess of York were just now come to London, after his
escape and shipwreck, as he went by sea for Scotland.

28th May, 1682. At the Rolls' chapel preached the famous Dr. Burnet on
2 Peter, i. 10, describing excellently well what was meant by election;
viz, not the effect of any irreversible decree, but so called because
they embraced the Gospel readily, by which they became elect, or
precious to God. It would be very needless to make our calling and
election sure, were they irreversible and what the rigid Presbyterians
pretend. In the afternoon, to St. Lawrence's church, a new and cheerful
pile.

29th May, 1682. I gave notice to the Bishop of Rochester of what
Maimburg had published about the motives of the late Duchess of York's
perversion, in his "History of Calvinism;" and did myself write to the
Bishop of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I urged him to
set forth his vindication.

31st May, 1682. The Morocco Ambassador being admitted an honorary member
of the Royal Society, and subscribing his name and titles in Arabic, I
was deputed by the Council to go and compliment him.

19th June, 1682. The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors (at this time we
had in London the Russian, Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being
invited to dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the
entertainment to contemplate the exotic guests. They were both very
hard-favored, and much resembling in countenance some sort of monkeys.
We ate at two tables, the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves.
Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz, a close
waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps
made like fruit baskets. They wore poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the
hafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly
keen, and of Damascus metal. They wore no sword. The second Ambassador
(sent it seems to succeed in case the first should die by the way in so
tedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a
little part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some other
difference of habit, and was half a negro, bare legged and naked feet,
and deemed a very holy man. They sat cross-legged like Turks, and
sometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as
black as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of
perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the toothache, much
raging in their country, is esteemed beautiful.

The first ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face, narrow eyes,
squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared; they wore several rings
of silver, gold and copper on their fingers, which was a token of
knighthood, or nobility. They were of Java Major, whose princes have
been turned Mahometans not above fifty years since; the inhabitants are
still pagans and idolaters. They seemed of a dull and heavy
constitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly
astonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking
we were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects
could possess anything but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being
all slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our
happiness. They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way.
Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat
slaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth
and loathsome. They ate their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without
spoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very
dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.

17th July, 1682. Came to dine with me, the Duke of Grafton and the young
Earl of Ossory, son to my most dear deceased friend.

30th July, 1682. Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr. Bohun, whose whole
house is a cabinet of all elegancies, especially Indian; in the hall are
contrivances of Japan screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an
excellent pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.
Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule. The landscapes of the screens
represent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese. But, above
all, his lady's cabinet is adorned on the fret, ceiling, and
chimney-piece, with Mr. Gibbons's best carving. There are also some of
Streeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of gold and silver
as growing in the mines. The gardens are exactly kept, and the whole
place very agreeable and well watered. The owners are good neighbors,
and Mr. Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight poor
people, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary accommodation.

1st August, 1682. To the Bishop of London at Fulham, to review the
additions which Mr. Marshall had made to his curious book of flowers in
miniature, and collection of insects.

4th August, 1682. With Sir Stephen Fox, to survey the foundations of the
Royal Hospital begun at Chelsea.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th August, 1682. The Council of the Royal Society had it recommended
to them to be trustees and visitors, or supervisors, of the Academy
which Monsieur Faubert did hope to procure to be built by subscription
of worthy gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and to
lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending children into
France to be taught military exercises. We thought to give him all the
encouragement our recommendation could procure.

15th August, 1682. Came to visit me Dr. Rogers, an acquaintance of mine
long since at Padua. He was then Consul of the English nation, and
student in that University, where he proceeded Doctor in Physic;
presenting me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the famous
Dr. Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians, at London.

20th August, 1682. This night I saw another comet, near Cancer, very
bright, but the stream not so long as the former.

29th August, 1682. Supped at Lord Clarendon's, with Lord Hyde, his
brother, now the great favorite, who invited himself to dine at my house
the Tuesday following.

30th October, 1682. Being my birthday, and I now entering my great
climacterical of 63, after serious recollections of the years past,
giving Almighty God thanks for all his merciful preservations and
forbearance, begging pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his
blessing on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to survey her
building, and give some directions for the garden at Chiswick; the
architect is Mr. May,--somewhat heavy and thick, and not so well
understood: the garden much too narrow, the place without water, near a
highway, and near another great house of my Lord Burlington, little land
about it, so that I wonder at the expense; but women will have their
will.

25th November, 1682. I was invited to dine with Monsieur Lionberg, the
Swedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it being the
birthday of his King. There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of
Hamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran, Lord Castlehaven,
the son of him who was executed fifty years before, and several great
persons. I was exceedingly afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast),
but the Duke of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,
excess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away and left the
company as soon as we rose from table.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

28th November, 1682. I went to the Council of the Royal Society, for the
auditing the last year's account, where I was surprised with a fainting
fit that for a time took away my sight; but God being merciful to me, I
recovered it after a short repose.

30th November, 1682. I was exceedingly endangered and importuned to
stand the election,[48] having so many voices, but by favor of my
friends, and regard of my remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities,
I desired their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins, one
of the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso as well as lawyer,
who accordingly was elected.

    [Footnote 48: For President of the Royal Society.]

7th December, 1682. Went to congratulate Lord Hyde (the great favorite)
newly made Earl of Rochester, and lately marrying his eldest daughter to
the Earl of Ossory.

18th December, 1682. I sold my East India adventure of £250 principal
for £750 to the Royal Society, after I had been in that company
twenty-five years, being extraordinarily advantageous, by the blessing
of God.

23d January, 1682-83. Sir Francis North, son to the Lord North, and Lord
Chief Justice, being made Lord Keeper on the death of the Earl of
Nottingham, the Lord Chancellor, I went to congratulate him. He is a
most knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being an
excellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition, very skillful
in music, painting, the new philosophy, and politer studies.

29th January, 1683. Supped at Sir Joseph Williamson's, where was a
select company of our Society, Sir William Petty, Dr. Gale (that learned
schoolmaster of St. Paul's), Dr. Whistler, Mr. Hill, etc. The
conversation was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable
questions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of the Roman
Emperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface to our Common Prayer, which
signifies only the Greek _Kalendarium_. These were mixed with lighter
subjects.

2d February, 1683. I made my court at St. James's, when I saw the sea
charts of Captain Collins, which that industrious man now brought to
show the Duke, having taken all the coasting from the mouth of the
Thames, as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek, island,
rock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending next spring to
proceed till he had finished the whole island, and that measured by
chains and other instruments: a most exact and useful undertaking. He
affirmed, that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant so
true as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the first in Queen
Elizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.

12th February, 1683. This morning I received the news of the death of my
father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, Knt. and Bart., who died at my house
at Sayes Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had labored
under the gout and dropsy for nearly six months, in the 78th year of his
age. The funeral was solemnized on the 19th at Deptford, with as much
decency as the dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;
there being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several noblemen, knights,
and all the fraternity of the Trinity Company, of which he had been
Master, and others of the country. The vicar preached a short but proper
discourse on Psalm xxxix. 10, on the frailty of our mortal condition,
concluding with an ample and well-deserved eulogy on the defunct,
relating to his honorable birth and ancestors, education, learning in
Greek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal
loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of supporting the
Church of England in its public worship during its persecution by the
late rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers
Bishops, Doctors of the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in
his house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the Papists
(then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its
visibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there.
Then he spoke of his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years'
exile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year
1660; his honorable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect
himself, his great age, infirmities, and death.

He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford on which are
built those almshouses for twenty-four widows of emerited seamen. He was
born the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the
last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir. His
grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the
great Earl of Leicester (favorite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government
of the Netherland. He was Master of the Household to King James, and
Cofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions through
England for the King's household, provisions, progresses,[49] etc.,
which was so high a service, and so grateful to the whole nation, that
he had acknowledgments and public thanks sent him from all the counties;
he died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement speech he made about the
compositions in a Parliament of King James. By his mother's side he was
a Gunson, Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII., Queen
Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large pedigree appears,
related to divers of the English nobility. Thus ended this honorable
person, after so many changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house
where he was born. "Lord teach us so to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom!"

    [Footnote 49: Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the
    "Diary." The different counties were bound to supply provisions of
    various kinds, and these were collected by officers called
    purveyors, whose extortions often excited the attention of
    Parliament.]

By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be
buried in the churchyard under the southeast window of the chancel,
adjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of
Essex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of
burying everyone within the body of the church and chancel; that being a
favor heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of
making churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example, and
prejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual
disturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies.
Dr. Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred, as may
be read in his testament.

16th March, 1683. I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in
planting walnut trees about his seat, and making fish ponds, many miles
in circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these
suddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves. He from a
merchant's apprentice, and management of the East India Company's stock,
being arrived to an estate (it is said) of £200,000; and lately married
his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of
Worcester, with £50,000 portional present, and various expectations.

I dined at Mr. Houblon's, a rich and gentle French merchant, who was
building a house in the Forest, near Sir J. Child's, in a place where
the late Earl of Norwich dwelt some time, and which came from his lady,
the widow of Mr. Baker. It will be a pretty villa, about five miles from
Whitechapel.

18th March, 1683. I went to hear Dr. Horneck preach at the Savoy Church,
on Phil. ii. 5. He was a German born, a most pathetic preacher, a person
of a saint-like life, and hath written an excellent treatise on
Consideration.

20th March, 1683. Dined at Dr. Whistler's, at the Physicians' College,
with Sir Thomas Millington, both learned men; Dr. W. the most facetious
man in nature, and now Censor of the college. I was here consulted where
they should build their library; it is a pity this college is built so
near Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole, a fault in placing most
of our public buildings and churches in the city, through the avarice of
some few men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in his
power after the dreadful conflagration.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st March, 1683. Dr. Tenison preached at Whitehall on 1 Cor. vi. 12; I
esteem him to be one of the most profitable preachers in the Church of
England, being also of a most holy conversation, very learned and
ingenious. The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear, wear
him out, which would be an inexpressible loss.

24th March, 1683. I went to hear Dr. Charleton's lecture on the heart in
the Anatomy Theater at the Physicians' College.

30th March, 1683. To London, in order to my passing the following week,
for the celebration of the Easter now approaching, there being in the
Holy Week so many eminent preachers officiating at the Court and other
places.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1683. GOOD FRIDAY. There was in the afternoon, according to
custom, a sermon before the King, at Whitehall; Dr. Sprat preached for
the Bishop of Rochester.

17th April, 1683. I was at the launching of the last of the thirty ships
ordered to be newly built by Act of Parliament, named the "Neptune," a
second rate, one of the goodliest vessels of the whole navy, built by my
kind neighbor, young Mr. Shish, his Majesty's master shipwright of this
dock.

1st May, 1683. I went to Blackheath, to see the new fair, being the
first procured by the Lord Dartmouth. This was the first day, pretended
for the sale of cattle, but I think in truth to enrich the new tavern at
the bowling-green, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a man full
of projects. There appeared nothing but an innumerable assembly of
drinking people from London, peddlars, etc., and I suppose it too near
London to be of any great use to the country.

March was unusually hot and dry, and all April excessively wet.

I planted all the out limits of the garden and long walks with
holly.[50]

    [Footnote 50: Evelyn adds a note: "400 feet in length, 9 feet high,
    5 in diameter, in my now ruined garden, thanks to the Czar of
    Muscovy."--"_Sylva_," book ii. chap. vi.]

9th May, 1683. Dined at Sir Gabriel Sylvius's and thence to visit the
Duke of Norfolk, to ask whether he would part with any of his cartoons
and other drawings of Raphael, and the great masters; he told me if he
might sell them all together he would, but that the late Sir Peter Lely
(our famous painter) had gotten some of his best. The person who desired
me to treat for them was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar,
contemporary and friend of Joseph Scaliger.

16th May, 1683. Came to dinner and visited me Sir Richard Anderson, of
Pendley, and his lady, with whom I went to London.

8th June, 1683. On my return home from the Royal Society, I found Mr.
Wilbraham, a young gentleman of Cheshire.

11th June, 1683. The Lord Dartmouth was elected Master of the Trinity
House; son to George Legge, late Master of the Ordnance, and one of the
grooms of the bedchamber; a great favorite of the Duke's, an active and
understanding gentleman in sea affairs.

13th June, 1683. To our Society, where we received the Count de
Zinzendorp, Ambassador from the Duke of Saxony, a fine young man; we
showed him divers experiments on the magnet, on which subject the
Society were upon.

16th June, 1683. I went to Windsor, dining by the way at Chiswick, at
Sir Stephen Fox's, where I found Sir Robert Howard (that universal
pretender), and Signor Verrio, who brought his draught and designs for
the painting of the staircase of Sir Stephen's new house.

That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising
to me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St. George's Hall,
representing the legend of St. George, and triumph of the Black Prince,
and his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally
finished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the
Ascension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most
famous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar. I liked the
contrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the
stupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our
Gibbons, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for
invention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor
doubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art.

Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique
and heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the
only doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist
climate prejudice), the work will preserve his name to ages.

There was now the terrace brought almost round the old castle; the
grass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new
park, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal,
and receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing
so huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the
castle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of
Sir Samuel Morland.

17th June, 1683. I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with the Earls of
Bath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of
London, the Grand Master of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vendôme (a
young wild spark), and Mr. Dryden, the poet. After evening prayer, I
walked in the park with my Lord Clarendon, where we fell into discourse
of the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr. Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc. Dr.
Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr. Turner, one of the Duke's
chaplains was made dean.

I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her Majesty, who
being hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was
going into the park to walk, it being now near eleven at night; the
alarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to
us.

By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection
that courtiers live in, who had not time to eat and drink at their
pleasure. It put me in mind of Horace's "Mouse," and to bless God for my
own private condition.

Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister of Charenton, lately
fled from the persecution in France, concerning the deplorable condition
of the Protestants there.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th June, 1683. I was present, and saw and heard the humble submission
and petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the
city of London, on the _quo warranto_ against their charter which they
delivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber. It was delivered
kneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council chamber,
the mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence chamber.
After a short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a
speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behavior in the
late election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common
hall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on the
government, etc., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high
displeasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles
as the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter
judgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended. The things
required were as follows: that they should neither elect mayor,
sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant town clerk, coroner, nor
steward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that if
they presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in
wonted manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty
to nominate them; and if within five days they thought good to assent to
this, all former miscarriages should be forgotten. And so they tamely
parted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been
treated by the King. This was a signal and most remarkable period. What
the consequences will prove, time will show. Divers of the old and most
learned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit
their charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanors;
but the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it
otherwise.

The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now
sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and
giddiness of Oates, so as the Papists began to hold up their heads
higher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.
Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been without anything
steady or prudent, for these last seven years.

19th June, 1683. I returned to town in a coach with the Earl of
Clarendon, when passing by the glorious palace of his father, built but
a few years before, which they were now demolishing, being sold to
certain undertakers, I turned my head the contrary way till the coach
had gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking of it;
which must needs have grieved him, that in so short a time their pomp
was fallen.

28th June, 1683. After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as
they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and
others should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they
were to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and
especially of the city of London, disaffected to the present Government.
Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of
the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr. Algernon Sidney, son to the
old Earl of Leicester, Mr. Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick,
and others. A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of
Monmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped beyond
sea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only
seizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretense of
the danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again
admitted to the councils and cabinet secrets. The Lords Essex and
Russell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention
against the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn
in by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management
relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters,
etc. They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false
brethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken
effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to
unknown and dangerous events; which God avert!

Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of
Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating. I pray God bless her, and may she
choose the better part!

[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1683. As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady,
in Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of
Essex having cut his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in
the Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant that Lord
Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of death. This accident
exceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a
person of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and
so much obliged to the King. It is certain the King and Duke were at the
Tower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when
my Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated
the horrid act. Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he
should do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and
wide, that being cut through the gullet, windpipe, and both the
jugulars, it reached to the very vertebræ of the neck, so that the head
held to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the
razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little strange; but more, that
having passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far,
that an executioner could hardly have done more with an ax. There were
odd reflections upon it.

The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord
Russell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury
and all the Bench to his prejudice. Others said that he had himself on
some occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his
life taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his
estate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favorably of
that Earl of Northumberland,[51] and some others, who made away with
themselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent
conversation that I have no inclination to credit them. What might
instigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture. My Lord
Clarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before,
assured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect
of his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no
severe intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to
Lord Russell and some of the rest. For my part, I believe the crafty and
ambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the
present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying
the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable
reasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and
felt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting
up some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy,
without much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for
which he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged
to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his
accomplices that a second day for an exploit of this nature was never
successful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox
died, three months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered
or suspected. Every one deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last,
as being thought to have been drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring
to rescue the King from his present councilors, and secure religion from
Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much
apprehended; while the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson
and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth,
and turn all things topsy-turvy. Of the same tragical principles is
Sydney.

    [Footnote 51: Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland, shot
    himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of
    high treason in June, 1585.]

I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous
and wise prime President of Bordeaux. This gentleman was owner of that
excellent _vignoble_ of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the
choicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what
was not so truly said of St. Paul, that much learning had made him mad.
He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was
exceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador
[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant
Eastern Jews. He spoke all languages, was very rich, had a handsome
person, and was well bred, about forty-five years of age.

14th July, 1683. I visited Mr. Fraser, a learned Scotch gentleman, whom
I had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and
government of his son, since dead at sea. He had now been in Holland at
the sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare
and curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value.
There were three or four Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers
Roman antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's impression.

15th July, 1683. A stranger, an old man, preached on Jerem. vi. 8, the
not hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people;
much after Bishop Andrew's method, full of logical divisions, in short
and broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the
pulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and
practical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had
greater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to
answer for thriving no better on it.

The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and
conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double
guards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park
shut up, few admitted to walk in it. The Papists, in the meantime, very
jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to
nothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as
they called them.

The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost
masters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing toward Vienna. On the other
side, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)
disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed up almost
all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a fifth universal monarchy; and
all this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from
our defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,
ambition, and to procure money for our vices. To this add our irreligion
and atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some,
and the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so
weak. In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity;
every moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to
anything. The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not
provoke him till he bear it no longer!

This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war to pass our Channel
toward the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had
abandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard
our coasts, or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation never
had more, or a better navy, yet the sea had never so slender a fleet.

19th July, 1683. George, Prince of Denmark, who had landed this day,
came to marry the Lady Anne, daughter to the Duke; so I returned home,
having seen the young gallant at dinner at Whitehall.

20th July, 1683. Several of the conspirators of the lower form were
executed at Tyburn; and the next day,

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st July, 1683. Lord Russell was beheaded in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the
executioner giving him three butcherly strokes. The speech he made, and
the paper which he gave the Sheriff declaring his innocence, the
nobleness of the family, the piety and worthiness of the unhappy
gentleman, wrought much pity, and occasioned various discourses on the
plot.

25th July, 1683. I again saw Prince George of Denmark: he had the Danish
countenance, blonde, of few words, spoke French but ill, seemed somewhat
heavy, but reported to be valiant, and indeed he had bravely rescued and
brought off his brother, the King of Denmark, in a battle against the
Swedes, when both these Kings were engaged very smartly.

28th July, 1683. He was married to the Lady Anne at Whitehall. Her Court
and household to be modeled as the Duke's, her father, had been, and
they to continue in England.

1st August, 1683. Came to see me Mr. Flamsted, the famous astronomer,
from his Observatory at Greenwich, to draw the meridian from my pendule,
etc.

2d August, 1683. The Countesses of Bristol and Sunderland, aunt and
cousin-german of the late Lord Russell, came to visit me, and condole
his sad fate. The next day, came Colonel Russell, uncle to the late Lord
Russell, and brother to the Earl of Bedford, and with him Mrs.
Middleton, that famous and indeed incomparable beauty, daughter to my
relation, Sir Robert Needham.

19th August, 1683. I went to Bromley to visit our Bishop, and excellent
neighbor, and to congratulate his now being made Archbishop of York. On
the 28th, he came to take his leave of us, now preparing for his journey
and residence in his province.

28th August, 1683. My sweet little grandchild, Martha Maria, died, and
on the 29th was buried in the parish church.

2d September, 1683. This morning, was read in the church, after the
office was done, the Declaration setting forth the late conspiracy
against the King's person.

3d September, 1683. I went to see what had been done by the Duke of
Beaufort on his lately purchased house at Chelsea, which I once had the
selling of for the Countess of Bristol, he had made great alterations,
but might have built a better house with the materials and the cost he
had been at.

Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had formerly known,
he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming a Protestant he resided in
England, and married into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire. The
Count, her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great
politician, and a goodly man. She was accompanied by her sister,
exceedingly skilled in painting, nor did they spare for color on their
own faces. They had a great deal of wit.

9th September, 1683. It being the day of public thanksgiving for his
Majesty's late preservation, the former Declaration was again read, and
there was an office used, composed for the occasion. A loyal sermon was
preached on the divine right of Kings, from Psalm cxliv. 10. "Thou hast
preserved David from the peril of the sword."

15th September, 1683. Came to visit me the learned anatomist, Dr.
Tyson,[52] with some other Fellows of our Society.

    [Footnote 52: Doctor Edward Tyson, a learned physician, born at
    Clevedon, Somersetshire, in 1649, who became reader of the
    anatomical lecture in Surgeons' Hall, and physician to the hospitals
    of Bethlehem and Bridewell, which offices he held at his death, Aug.
    1, 1708. He was an ingenious writer, and has left various Essays in
    the Philosophical Transactions and Hook's Collections. He published
    also "The Anatomy of a Porpoise Dissected at Gresham College," and
    "The Anatomy of a Pigmy Compared with a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man,"
    4to., 1698-99.]

16th September, 1683. At the elegant villa and garden of Mr. Bohun, at
Lee. He showed me the zinnar tree, or platanus, and told me that since
they had planted this kind of tree about the city of Ispahan, in Persia,
the plague, which formerly much infested the place, had exceedingly
abated of its mortal effects, and rendered it very healthy.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th September, 1683. I went to London to visit the Duchess of Grafton,
now great with child, a most virtuous and beautiful lady. Dining with
her at my Lord Chamberlain's, met my Lord of St. Alban's, now grown so
blind, that he could not see to take his meat. He has lived a most easy
life, in plenty even abroad, while his Majesty was a sufferer; he has
lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty years old, he
continues, having one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.
He ate and drank with extraordinary appetite. He is a prudent old
courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return.

After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon House,
that costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde,
where I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:
happening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry
Parliament, accusing him of maladministration, and being envious at his
grandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke
of York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage
with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed. To this they imputed
much of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favorite
at his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering
party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles. But perhaps
as many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept
the government far steadier than it has proved since. I could name some
who I think contributed greatly to his ruin,--the buffoons and the
MISSIS, to whom he was an eye-sore. It is true he was of a jolly temper,
after the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we
were become quite another nation. The Chancellor gone, and dying in
exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost £50,000 building, to
the young Duke of Albemarle for £25,000, to pay debts which how
contracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal. Some
imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him. However it
were, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious
waste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man
died. He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich
bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, £35,000;
they design a new town, as it were, and a most magnificent piazza
[square]. It is said they have already materials toward it with what
they sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it. See
the vicissitudes of earthly things! I was astonished at this demolition,
nor less at the little army of laborers and artificers leveling the
ground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense
of £200,000, if they perfect their design.

19th September, 1683. In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's
workhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading
and oily metal. He said it must be finer than the standard, such as was
old angel-gold, and that of such he had once to the value of £100
stamped with the _agnus dei_, and coined at the time of the holy war;
which had been found in a ruined wall somewhere in the North, near to
Scotland, some of which he beat into leaves, and the rest sold to the
curiosi in antiquities and medals.

23d September, 1683. We had now the welcome tidings of the King of
Poland raising the siege of Vienna, which had given terror to all
Europe, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in
the Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily
swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on the empire, while we
sat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody.

There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, consumed by an
accidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was
intended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their
rendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence. This made the King
more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field
diversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient
castle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects,
air, pleasure, and provisions. The surveyor has already begun the
foundation for a palace, estimated to cost £35,000, and his Majesty is
purchasing ground about it to make a park, etc.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th October, 1683. I went to London, on receiving a note from the
Countess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might
obtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of
his Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter; the proposal
made me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent
transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put
upon things of this nature against so great a city, the consequence
whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home. At this
time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced. He was held to be
the most learned of the judges, and an honest man. Sir George Jeffreys
was advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring. Sir George
Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and one Genner, an obscure
lawyer, set in his place. Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were
removed and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more
wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and two sheriffs
holding their places by new grants as _custodes_, at the King's
pleasure. The pomp and grandeur of the most august city in the world
thus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse
and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in. Prudent men were for
the old foundations.

Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the
few who attended him, into the Duchess of Portmouth's DRESSING ROOM
within her bedchamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her
maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants
standing about her; but that which engaged my curiosity, was the rich
and splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice
pulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures,
while her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture
and accommodation. Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for
design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best
paintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld. Some pieces had
Versailles, St. Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with
huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life
rarely done. Then for Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great
vases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,
branches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of number, besides
some of her Majesty's best paintings.

Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home
to my poor, but quiet villa. What contentment can there be in the riches
and splendor of this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?

10th October, 1683. Visited the Duchess of Grafton, not yet brought to
bed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain (her father), went with them to
see Montague House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had
married the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland. It is a stately
and ample palace. Signor Verrio's fresco paintings, especially the
funeral pile of Dido, on the staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight
with the Centaurs, his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or
reception among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room
above,--I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both for design,
coloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable to the greatest of the
old masters, or what they so celebrate at Rome. In the rest of the
chamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters. The
garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not
answerable to the inside. The court at entry, and wings for offices seem
too near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the
corridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being
overlooked by neighbors; all which might have been prevented, had they
placed the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to
spare. But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French
pavilion-way, by Mr. Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society. There were
with us my Lady Scroope, the great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the
celebrated traveler.

13th October, 1683. Came to visit me my old and worthy friend, Mr.
Packer, bringing with him his nephew Berkeley, grandson to the honest
judge. A most ingenious, virtuous, and religious gentleman, seated near
Worcester, and very curious in gardening.

17th October, 1683. I was at the court-leet of this manor, my Lord
Arlington his Majesty's High Steward.

26th October, 1683. Came to visit and dine with me, Mr. Brisbane,
Secretary to the Admiralty, a learned and agreeable man.

30th October, 1683. I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry Capell, brother to
the late Earl of Essex; but he being gone to Cashiobury, after I had
seen his garden and the alterations therein, I returned home. He had
repaired his house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a
niche was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me
over-melancholy, yet might be much improved by having the walls well
painted _á fresco_. The two green houses for oranges and myrtles,
communicating with the rooms below, are very well contrived. There is a
cupola made with pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which
being covered by plashing the trees to them, is very pretty; for the
rest there are too many fir trees in the garden.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th November, 1683. I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings,
for the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the
education of my daughters.

23d November, 1683. The Duke of Monmouth, till now proclaimed traitor on
the pretended plot for which Lord Russell was lately beheaded, came this
evening to Whitehall and rendered himself, on which were various
discourses.

26th November, 1683. I went to compliment the Duchess of Grafton, now
lying-in of her first child, a son, which she called for, that I might
see it. She was become more beautiful, if it were possible, than before,
and full of virtue and sweetness. She discoursed with me of many
particulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her years.

29th November, 1683. Mr. Forbes showed me the plot of the garden making
at Burleigh, at my Lord Exeter's, which I looked on as one of the most
noble that I had seen.

The whole court and town in solemn mourning for the death of the King of
Portugal, her Majesty's brother.

30th November, 1683. At the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society the
King sent us two does. Sir Cyril Wych was elected President.

5th December, 1683. I was this day invited to a wedding of one Mrs.
Castle, to whom I had some obligation, and it was to her fifth husband,
a lieutenant-colonel of the city. She was the daughter of one Burton, a
broom-man, by his wife, who sold kitchen stuff in Kent Street, whom God
so blessed that the father became a very rich, and was a very honest
man; he was sheriff of Surrey, where I have sat on the bench with him.
Another of his daughters was married to Sir John Bowles; and this
daughter was a jolly friendly woman. There was at the wedding the Lord
Mayor, the Sheriff, several Aldermen and persons of quality; above all,
Sir George Jeffreys, newly made Lord Chief Justice of England, with Mr.
Justice Withings, danced with the bride, and were exceedingly merry.
These great men spent the rest of the afternoon, till eleven at night,
in drinking healths, taking tobacco, and talking much beneath the
gravity of judges, who had but a day or two before condemned Mr.
Algernon Sidney, who was executed the 7th on Tower Hill, on the single
witness of that monster of a man, Lord Howard of Escrick, and some
sheets of paper taken in Mr. Sidney's study, pretended to be written by
him, but not fully proved, nor the time when, but appearing to have been
written before his Majesty's Restoration, and then pardoned by the Act
of Oblivion; so that though Mr. Sidney was known to be a person
obstinately averse to government by a monarch (the subject of the paper
was in answer to one by Sir E. Filmer), yet it was thought he had very
hard measure. There is this yet observable, that he had been an
inveterate enemy to the last king, and in actual rebellion against him;
a man of great courage, great sense, great parts, which he showed both
at his trial and death; for, when he came on the scaffold, instead of a
speech, he told them only that he had made his peace with God, that he
came not thither to talk, but to die; put a paper into the sheriff's
hand, and another into a friend's; said one prayer as short as a grace,
laid down his neck, and bid the executioner do his office.

The Duke of Monmouth, now having his pardon, refuses to acknowledge
there was any treasonable plot; for which he is banished Whitehall. This
is a great disappointment to some who had prosecuted Trenchard, Hampden,
etc., that for want of a second witness were come out of the Tower upon
their _habeas corpus_.

The King had now augmented his guards with a new sort of dragoons, who
carried also grenades, and were habited after the Polish manner, with
long peaked caps, very fierce and fantastical.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th December, 1683. I went to the Tower, and visited the Earl of Danby,
the late Lord High Treasurer, who had been imprisoned four years: he
received me with great kindness. I dined with him, and stayed till
night. We had discourse of many things, his Lady railing sufficiently at
the keeping her husband so long in prison. Here I saluted the Lord
Dumblaine's wife, who before had been married to Emerton, and about whom
there was that scandalous business before the delegates.

23d December, 1683. The smallpox very prevalent and mortal; the Thames
frozen.

26th December, 1683. I dined at Lord Clarendon's, where I was to meet
that ingenious and learned gentleman, Sir George Wheeler, who has
published the excellent description of Africa and Greece, and who, being
a knight of a very fair estate and young, had now newly entered into
holy orders.

27th December, 1683. I went to visit Sir John Chardin, a French
gentleman, who traveled three times by land into Persia, and had made
many curious researches in his travels, of which he was now setting
forth a relation. It being in England this year one of the severest
frosts that has happened of many years, he told me the cold in Persia
was much greater, the ice of an incredible thickness; that they had
little use of iron in all that country, it being so moist (though the
air admirably clear and healthy) that oil would not preserve it from
rusting, so that they had neither clocks nor watches; some padlocks they
had for doors and boxes.

30th December, 1683. Dr. Sprat, now made Dean of Westminster, preached
to the King at Whitehall, on Matt. vi. 24. Recollecting the passages of
the past year, I gave God thanks for his mercies, praying his blessing
for the future.

1st January, 1683-84. The weather continuing intolerably severe, streets
of booths were set up on the Thames; the air was so very cold and thick,
as of many years there had not been the like. The smallpox was very
mortal.

2d January, 1684. I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's: after dinner came a
fellow who ate live charcoal, glowingly ignited, quenching them in his
mouth, and then champing and swallowing them down. There was a dog also
which seemed to do many rational actions.

6th January, 1684. The river quite frozen.

9th January, 1684. I went across the Thames on the ice, now become so
thick as to bear not only streets of booths, in which they roasted meat,
and had divers shops of wares, quite across as in a town, but coaches,
carts, and horses passed over. So I went from Westminster stairs to
Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop: where I met my Lord Bruce, Sir
George Wheeler, Colonel Cooke, and several divines. After dinner and
discourse with his Grace till evening prayers, Sir George Wheeler and I
walked over the ice from Lambeth stairs to the Horse-ferry.

10th January, 1684. I visited Sir Robert Reading, where after supper we
had music, but not comparable to that which Mrs. Bridgeman made us on
the guitar with such extraordinary skill and dexterity.

16th January, 1684. The Thames was filled with people and tents selling
all sorts of wares as in the city.

24th January, 1684. The frost continues more and more severe, the Thames
before London was still planted with booths in formal streets, all sorts
of trades and shops furnished, and full of commodities, even to a
printing press, where the people and ladies took a fancy to have their
names printed, and the day and year set down when printed on the Thames:
this humor took so universally, that it was estimated that the printer
gained £5 a day, for printing a line only, at sixpence a name, besides
what he got by ballads, etc. Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other stairs to and fro, as in the streets,
sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting, horse and coach-races,
puppet-plays and interludes, cooks, tippling, and other lewd places, so
that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water,
while it was a severe judgment on the land, the trees not only splitting
as if the lightning struck, but men and cattle perishing in divers
places, and the very seas so locked up with ice, that no vessels could
stir out or come in. The fowls, fish, and birds, and all our exotic
plants and greens, universally perishing. Many parks of deer were
destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear, that there were great
contributions to preserve the poor alive. Nor was this severe weather
much less intense in most parts of Europe, even as far as Spain and the
most southern tracts. London, by reason of the excessive coldness of the
air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous
steam of the sea-coal, that hardly could one see across the street, and
this filling the lungs with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed
the breast, so as one could scarcely breathe. Here was no water to be
had from the pipes and engines, nor could the brewers and divers other
tradesmen work, and every moment was full of disastrous accidents.

4th February, 1684. I went to Sayes Court to see how the frost had
dealt with my garden, where I found many of the greens and rare plants
utterly destroyed. The oranges and myrtles very sick, the rosemary and
laurels dead to all appearance, but the cypress likely to endure it.

5th February, 1684. It began to thaw, but froze again. My coach crossed
from Lambeth, to the Horse-ferry at Milbank, Westminster. The booths
were almost all taken down; but there was first a map or landscape cut
in copper representing all the manner of the camp, and the several
actions, sports, and pastimes thereon, in memory of so signal a frost.

7th February, 1684. I dined with my Lord Keeper, [North], and walking
alone with him some time in his gallery, we had discourse of music. He
told me he had been brought up to it from a child, so as to sing his
part at first sight. Then speaking of painting, of which he was also a
great lover, and other ingenious matters, he desired me to come oftener
to him.

8th February, 1684. I went this evening to visit that great and knowing
virtuoso, Monsieur Justell. The weather was set in to an absolute thaw
and rain; but the Thames still frozen.

10th February, 1684. After eight weeks missing the foreign posts, there
came abundance of intelligence from abroad.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1684. The Earl of Danby, late Lord-Treasurer, together
with the Roman Catholic Lords impeached of high treason in the Popish
Plot, had now their _habeas corpus_, and came out upon bail, after five
years' imprisonment in the Tower. Then were also tried and deeply fined
Mr. Hampden and others, for being supposed of the late plot, for which
Lord Russell and Colonel Sidney suffered; as also the person who went
about to prove that the Earl of Essex had his throat cut in the Tower by
others; likewise Mr. Johnson, the author of that famous piece called
Julian.

15th February, 1684. News of the Prince of Orange having accused the
Deputies of Amsterdam of _crimen læsæ Majestatis_, and being pensioners
to France.

Dr. Tenison communicated to me his intention of erecting a library in
St. Martin's parish, for the public use, and desired my assistance, with
Sir Christopher Wren, about the placing and structure thereof, a worthy
and laudable design. He told me there were thirty or forty young men in
Orders in his parish, either governors to young gentlemen or chaplains
to noblemen, who being reproved by him on occasion for frequenting
taverns or coffeehouses, told him they would study or employ their time
better, if they had books. This put the pious Doctor on this design; and
indeed a great reproach it is that so great a city as London should not
have a public library becoming it. There ought to be one at St. Paul's;
the west end of that church (if ever finished) would be a convenient
place.

23d February, 1684. I went to Sir John Chardin, who desired my
assistance for the engraving the plates, the translation, and printing
his History of that wonderful Persian Monument near Persepolis, and
other rare antiquities, which he had caused to be drawn from the
originals in his second journey into Persia, which we now concluded
upon. Afterward, I went with Sir Christopher Wren to Dr. Tenison, where
we made the drawing and estimate of the expense of the library, to be
begun this next spring near the Mews.

Great expectation of the Prince of Orange's attempts in Holland to bring
those of Amsterdam to consent to the new levies, to which we were no
friends, by a pseudo-politic adherence to the French interest.

26th February, 1684. Came to visit me Dr. Turner, our new Bishop of
Rochester.

28th February, 1684. I dined at Lady Tuke's, where I heard Dr. Walgrave
(physician to the Duke and Duchess) play excellently on the lute.

7th March, 1684. Dr. Meggot, Dean of Winchester, preached an
incomparable sermon (the King being now gone to Newmarket), on Heb. xii.
15, showing and pathetically pressing the care we ought to have lest we
come short of the grace of God. Afterward, I went to visit Dr. Tenison
at Kensington, whither he was retired to refresh, after he had been sick
of the smallpox.

15th March, 1684. At Whitehall preached Mr. Henry Godolphin, a prebend
of St. Paul's, and brother to my dear friend Sydney, on Isaiah 1v. 7. I
dined at the Lord Keeper's, and brought him to Sir John Chardin, who
showed him his accurate drafts of his travels in Persia.

28th March, 1684. There was so great a concourse of people with their
children to be touched for the Evil, that six or seven were crushed to
death by pressing at the chirurgeon's door for tickets. The weather
began to be more mild and tolerable; but there was not the least
appearance of any spring.

30th March, 1684. Easter day. The Bishop of Rochester preached before
the King; after which his Majesty, accompanied with three of his natural
sons, the Dukes of Northumberland, Richmond, and St. Alban (sons of
Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Nelly), went up to the altar; the three boys
entering before the King within the rails, at the right hand, and three
bishops on the left: London (who officiated), Durham, and Rochester,
with the subdean, Dr. Holder. The King, kneeling before the altar,
making his offering, the Bishops first received, and then his Majesty;
after which he retired to a canopied seat on the right hand. Note, there
was perfume burned before the office began. I had received the Sacrament
at Whitehall early with the Lords and household, the Bishop of London
officiating. Then went to St. Martin's, where Dr. Tenison preached
(recovered from the smallpox); then went again to Whitehall as above. In
the afternoon, went to St. Martin's again.

4th April, 1684. I returned home with my family to my house at Sayes
Court, after five months' residence in London; hardly the least
appearance of any spring.

30th April, 1684. A letter of mine to the Royal Society concerning the
terrible effects of the past winter being read, they desired it might be
printed in the next part of their "Transactions."

[Sidenote: SURREY]

10th May, 1684. I went to visit my brother in Surrey. Called by the way
at Ashted, where Sir Robert Howard (Auditor of the Exchequer)
entertained me very civilly at his newly-built house, which stands in a
park on the Down, the avenue south; though down hill to the house, which
is not great, but with the outhouses very convenient. The staircase is
painted by Verrio with the story of Astrea; among other figures is the
picture of the painter himself, and not unlike him; the rest is well
done, only the columns did not at all please me; there is also Sir
Robert's own picture in an oval; the whole in _fresco_. The place has
this great defect, that there is no water but what is drawn up by horses
from a very deep well.

11th May, 1684. Visited Mr. Higham, who was ill, and died three days
after. His grandfather and father (who christened me), with himself, had
now been rectors of this parish 101 years, viz, from May, 1583.

12th May, 1684. I returned to London, where I found the Commissioners of
the Admiralty abolished, and the office of Admiral restored to the Duke,
as to the disposing and ordering all sea business; but his Majesty
signed all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the Duke,
not acting as admiral by commission or office, might not incur the
penalty of the late Act against Papists and Dissenters holding offices,
and refusing the oath and test. Every one was glad of this change, those
in the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty, to the
great damage of the Navy.

The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by the siege of
Luxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by the obstinacy of the
Hollanders, who refused to assist the Prince of Orange, being corrupted
by the French.

16th May, 1684. I received £600 of Sir Charles Bickerstaff for the fee
farm of Pilton, in Devon.

26th May, 1684. Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master of the Trinity Company,
newly returned with the fleet from blowing up and demolishing Tangier.
In the sermon preached on this occasion, Dr. Can observed that, in the
27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting anchor out of the
fore ship had been caviled at as betraying total ignorance: that it is
very true our seamen do not do so; but in the Mediterranean their ships
were built differently from ours, and to this day it was the practice to
do so there.

Luxemburg was surrendered to the French, which makes them master of all
the Netherlands, gives them entrance into Germany, and a fair game for
universal monarchy; which that we should suffer, who only and easily
might have hindered, astonished all the world. Thus is the poor Prince
of Orange ruined, and this nation and all the Protestant interest in
Europe following, unless God in his infinite mercy, as by a miracle,
interpose, and our great ones alter their counsels. The French fleet
were now besieging Genoa, but after burning much of that beautiful city
with their bombs, went off with disgrace.

11th June, 1684. My cousin, Verney, to whom a very great fortune was
fallen, came to take leave of us, going into the country; a very worthy
and virtuous young gentleman.

12th June, 1684. I went to advise and give directions about the building
of two streets in Berkeley Garden, reserving the house and as much of
the garden as the breadth of the house. In the meantime, I could not but
deplore that sweet place (by far the most noble gardens, courts, and
accommodations, stately porticos, etc., anywhere about the town) should
be so much straitened and turned into tenements. But that magnificent
pile and gardens contiguous to it, built by the late Lord Chancellor
Clarendon, being all demolished, and designed for piazzas and buildings,
was some excuse for my Lady Berkeley's resolution of letting out her
ground also for so excessive a price as was offered, advancing near
£1,000 per annum in mere ground rents; to such a mad intemperance was
the age come of building about a city, by far too disproportionate
already to the nation:[53] I having in my time seen it almost as large
again as it was within my memory.

    [Footnote 53: What would Evelyn think if he could see what is now
    called London?]

22d June, 1684. Last Friday, Sir Thomas Armstrong was executed at Tyburn
for treason, without trial, having been outlawed and apprehended in
Holland, on the conspiracy of the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, etc.,
which gave occasion of discourse to people and lawyers, in regard it was
on an outlawry that judgment was given and execution.[54]

    [Footnote 54: When brought up for judgment, Armstrong insisted on
    his right to a trial, the act giving that right to those who came in
    within a year, and the year not having expired. Jefferies refused
    it; and when Armstrong insisted that he asked nothing but law,
    Jefferies told him he should have it to the full, and ordered his
    execution in six days. When Jefferies went to the King at Windsor
    soon after, the King took a ring from his finger and gave it to
    Jefferies. BURNET, ii. 989.]

[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

2d July, 1684. I went to the Observatory at Greenwich, where Mr.
Flamsted took his observations of the eclipse of the sun, now almost
three parts obscured.

There had been an excessively hot and dry spring, and such a drought
still continued as never was in my memory.

13th July, 1684. Some small sprinkling of rain; the leaves dropping
from the trees as in autumn.

25th July, 1684. I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer of the Navy,
where after dinner we had rare music, there being among others, Signor
Pietro Reggio, and Signor John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice,
the other for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding
him. There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.

26th July, 1684. I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice
[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,
who dined with me.

10th August, 1684. We had now rain after such a drought as no man in
England had known.

24th August, 1684. Excessively hot. We had not had above one or two
considerable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months. Many
trees died for the want of refreshment.

31st August, 1684. Mr. Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.

26th September, 1684. The King being returned from Winchester, there was
a numerous Court at Whitehall.

At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the
Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner
of the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin. These alterations being very
unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.

There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,
to his Majesty.

22d October, 1684. I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the
rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought
into England. She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold
(as I remember) for above £2,000. At the same time, I went to see a
crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the
Egyptian crocodile.

24th October, 1684. I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of
Northumberland. He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well
bred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his
campaign at the siege of Luxemburg. Of all his Majesty's children (of
which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth
the owning. He is extraordinarily handsome and well shaped. What the
Dukes of Richmond and St. Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet
discover; they are very pretty boys.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1684. Dr. Goodman preached before the King on James ii.
12, concerning the law of liberty: an excellent discourse and in good
method. He is author of "The Prodigal Son," a treatise worth reading,
and another of the old religion.

27th October, 1684. I visited the Lord Chamberlain, where dined the
BLACK BARON and Monsieur Flamerin, who had so long been banished from
France for a duel.

28th October, 1684. I carried Lord Clarendon through the city amid all
the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal
Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner.

I went to St. Clement's, that prettily built and contrived church where
a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on 1 Cor. vi. 20, inciting to
gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the
dignity of our nature.

2d November, 1684. A sudden change from temperate warm weather to an
excessive cold rain, frost, snow, and storm, such as had seldom been
known. This winter weather began as early and fierce as the past did
late; till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.

4th November, 1684. Dr. Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely
upon the death of Dr. Peter Gunning, preached before the King at
Whitehall on Romans iii. 8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the
Church of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome. He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our
Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and
rebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my
certain observation a great truth.

15th November, 1684. Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks
on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and
other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and
mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here. But
the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very
water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and
then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with
grenades and innumerable other devices. It is said it cost £1,500. It
was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants
danced in the great hall. The court had not been seen so brave and rich
in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.

30th November, 1684. In the morning, Dr. Fiennes, son of the Lord Say
and Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi. 11.

3d December, 1684. I carried Mr. Justell and Mr. Slingsby (Master of the
Mint), to see Mr. Sheldon's collection of medals. The series of Popes
was rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John
Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars some
Greek, etc., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a
medallion of Otho Paulus Æmilius, etc., ancient. They were held at a
price of £1,000; but not worth, I judge, above £200.

7th December, 1684. I went to see the new church at St. James's,
elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble
inclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about
the walls by Mr. Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her
breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border
environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered,
and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was
said) of £200. There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there
been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.

17th December, 1684. Early in the morning I went into St. James's Park
to see three Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now first
shown to his Majesty. There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg. They were taken from a Bashaw at
the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer. I never
beheld so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat a bright
bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast,
belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful,
and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt,
turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable. With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what
I remember Busbequius, speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in
Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them
retain their ill habits. They trotted like does, as if they did not feel
the ground. Five hundred guineas was demanded for the first; 300 for the
second; and 200 for the third, which was brown. All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect as the
first.

It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of
Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled
in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of
the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never
seen any horses in these parts to be compared with them. Add to all
this, the furniture consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings,
quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, _à la
Turcisq_; the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine
I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of
silver, curiously wrought and double gilt to an incredible value. Such
and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it. The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered
with chains of silver gilt. There was also a Turkish royal standard of a
horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a
general's horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be
seen more glorious. The gentleman (a German) who rode the horse, was in
all this garb. They were shod with iron made round and closed at the
heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling. The hoofs
most entire.

18th December, 1684. I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young
gallants do their exercise. Mr. Faubert having newly railed in a manage,
and fitted it for the academy. There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham. The exercises were, 1, running at the ring; 2, flinging a
javelin at a Moor's head; 3, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly
taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in
full speed. The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in
every one, a dozen times, as I think. The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding
bravely. Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous. Here I
saw the difference of what the French call "_bel homme à cheval_," and
"_bon homme à cheval_"; the Duke of Norfolk being the first, that is
rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both
in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider. But the
Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these twelve
years before. There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the
Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of
the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.

20th December, 1684. A villainous murder was perpetrated by Mr. St.
John, eldest son to Sir Walter St. John, a worthy gentleman, on a knight
of quality, in a tavern. The offender was sentenced and reprieved. So
many horrid murders and duels were committed about this time as were
never before heard of in England; which gave much cause of complaint and
murmurings.

1st January, 1684-85. It proved so sharp weather, and so long and cruel
a frost, that the Thames was frozen across, but the frost was often
dissolved, and then froze again.

11th January, 1685. A young man preached upon St. Luke xiii. 5, after
the Presbyterian tedious method and repetition.

24th January, 1685. I dined at Lord Newport's, who had some excellent
pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the
best he ever painted; another of our English Dobson's painting; but,
above all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable piece;
with something of most other famous hands.

25th January, 1685. Dr. Dove preached before the King. I saw this
evening such a scene of profuse gaming, and the King in the midst of his
three concubines, as I have never before seen--luxurious dallying and
profaneness.

27th January, 1685. I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being invited to hear
that celebrated voice of Mr. Pordage, newly come from Rome; his singing
was after the Venetian recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an
excellent voice both treble and bass; Dr. Walgrave accompanied it with
his THEORBO LUTE, on which he performed beyond imagination, and is
doubtless one of the greatest masters in Europe on that charming
instrument. Pordage is a priest, as Mr. Bernard Howard told me in
private.

There was in the room where we dined, and in his bedchamber, those
incomparable pieces of Columbus, a Flagellation, the Grammar school, the
Venus and Adonis of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late
Earl of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and Earl of
Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of incomparable performance;
besides that of Moses and the burning bush of Bassano, and several other
pieces of the best masters. A marble head of M. Brutus, etc.

28th January, 1685. I was invited to my Lord Arundel's, of Wardour (now
newly released of his six years' confinement in the Tower on suspicion
of the plot called Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr.
Pordage entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the harpsichord. My
daughter Mary being with us, she also sang to the great satisfaction of
both the masters, and a world of people of quality present.

She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we
had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a
delicate voice, and had been well taught. I also heard Mrs. Packer
(daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was
so loud as took away much of the sweetness. Certainly never woman had a
stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it. She would
do rarely in a large church among the nuns.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th February, 1685. I went to London, hearing his Majesty had been the
Monday before (2d February) surprised in his bedchamber with an
apoplectic fit, so that if, by God's providence, Dr. King (that
excellent chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment; which might have been of direful
consequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this
Doctor and one more, as I am assured. It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him
bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me. This rescued his Majesty
for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve. He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,
till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and
both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that day about
noon, the physicians thought him feverish. This they seemed glad of, as
being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former
fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a
fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp
operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder
might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made
him very weak. Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when
complaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood
from him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him
relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and
struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after
eleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th
year of his reign, and 54th of his age.

Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the
Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half
quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he
expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices. Those
who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr. Ken, the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the
receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of
it, which he did so long till it was too late. Others whispered that the
Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to
administer the Popish offices. He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke
who was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears. He
also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the
Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure. He entreated
the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had
sent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if
at any time she had offended him. He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the
Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might
not starve.

    [Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and
    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,
    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do
    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common
    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where
    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,
    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,
    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him
    if he was sorry for his sins? which the King saying he was, the
    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased
    to receive the Sacrament? to which the King made no reply; and being
    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that
    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.

    King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and
    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and
    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little
    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a
    priest, to which the King replied: "For God's sake, brother, do, and
    lose no time." The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none
    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant
    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back
    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the
    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the
    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the
    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being
    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the
    Sacrament.--"Life of James II."]

Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and
in all appearance promising a long life. He was a prince of many
virtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not
bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in
shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew
of many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he
loved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,
which passed to luxury and intolerable expense. He had a particular
talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had
innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too
presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused. He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his
bedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,
which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty
and stinking. He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he
been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to
supply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent
persons who had signally served both him and his father. He frequently
and easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.

As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not
here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious
opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,
and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature
resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane
wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he
had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much
experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures
took him from off all application becoming so great a King. The history
of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical
death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous
restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,
fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand
other particulars. He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all
occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his
loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.

His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately
to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately
declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession
had fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however
he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should
find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as
great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its
principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing
themselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never
depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life
in defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in
all its lawful rights and liberties.

    [Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words
    employed) of what is stated by King James II. in the MS. printed in
    his life; but in that MS. are some words which Evelyn has omitted.
    For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England
    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, "AND THEREFORE I SHALL
    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT." James then goes on to
    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,
    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr. Finch (then
    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that
    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,
    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty
    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing
    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to
    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published. The
    King afterward proceeds to say: "No one can wonder that Mr. Finch
    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the
    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass
    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to
    promise both security to their religion and protection to their
    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by
    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established
    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he
    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the
    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience
    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his
    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or
    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,
    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they
    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a
    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of
    expressing it which Mr. Finch had made choice of, he thought it
    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he
    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in
    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended
    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further
    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath
    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained
    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in
    England."--"Life of James II.," ii. 435. The words printed in small
    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King
    James II.]

This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be
published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous
people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to. Then were the
Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all
officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no
failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known.
Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where,
while he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber to take order for
the PROCLAIMING his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented
should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after
the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc., should
proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it.
Upon this was I, and several other gentlemen waiting in the Privy
gallery, admitted into the Council chamber to be witness of what was
resolved on. Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other
Crown officers being ready, we first went to Whitehall gate, where the
Lords stood on foot bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his
Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the
form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first sounded three times,
which ended with the people's acclamations. Then a herald called the
Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor
and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and
proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we
returned in the order we set forth. Being come to Whitehall, we all went
and kissed the King and Queen's hands. He had been on the bed, but was
now risen and in his undress. The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but
put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was,
having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came
into England, which made her universally beloved.

Thus concluded this sad and not joyful day.

I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and
all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being
Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King
sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and
Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love songs[57] in that glorious
gallery, while about twenty of the great courtiers and other dissolute
persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made
reflections with astonishment. Six days after, was all in the dust.

    [Footnote 57: _Ante_, p. 204.]

It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a
father, in the most solemn manner.

10th February, 1685. Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to
appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to
Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop,
with an appearance, I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant with other
officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town,
marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market place, where, making a
ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read
the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and
then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk
in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers,
and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.

13th February, 1685. I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in
Staffordshire, being about £20 per annum, which lying so great a
distance, I thought fit to part with it to one Burton, a farmer there.
It came to me as part of my daughter-in-law's portion, this being but a
fourth part of what was divided between the mother and three sisters.

14th February, 1685. The King was this night very obscurely buried in a
vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of
pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the
whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral
behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery. All
the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form.

15th February, 1685. Dr. Tenison preached to the household. The second
sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of
his subjects, did now, for the first time, go to mass publicly in the
little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open.

16th February, 1685. I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, auditor of the
exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences,
for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir
Positive; not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting. He was son to the
late Earl of Berkshire.

17th February, 1685. This morning his Majesty restored the staff and key
to Lord Arlington, Chamberlain; to Mr. Savell, Vice-chamberlain; to
Lords Newport and Maynard, Treasurer and Comptroller of the household.
Lord Godolphin made Chamberlain to the Queen; Lord Peterborough groom of
the stole, in place of the Earl of Bath; the Treasurer's staff to the
Earl of Rochester; and his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord Privy
Seal, in the place of the Marquis of Halifax, who was made President of
the Council; the Secretaries of State remaining as before.

19th February, 1685. The Lord Treasurer and the other new officers were
sworn at the Chancery Bar and the exchequer.

The late King having the revenue of excise, customs, and other late
duties granted for his life only, they were now farmed and let to
several persons, upon an opinion that the late King might let them for
three years after his decease; some of the old commissioners refused to
act. The lease was made but the day before the King died;[58] the major
part of the Judges (but, as some think, not the best lawyers),
pronounced it legal, but four dissented.

    [Footnote 58: James, in his Life, makes no mention of this lease,
    but only says HE continued to collect them, which conduct was not
    blamed; but, on the contrary, he was thanked for it, in an address
    from the Middle Temple, penned by Sir Bartholomew Shore, and
    presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, carrying great authority with
    it; nor did the Parliament find fault.]

The clerk of the closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next
the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and
that prayers should be said as formerly.

22d February, 1685. Several most useful tracts against Dissenters,
Papists and Fanatics, and resolutions of cases were now published by the
London divines.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th March, 1685. ASH WEDNESDAY. After evening prayers, I went to London.

5th March, 1685. To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish
Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said,
and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had
ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew
jealous as to what this would tend.

A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain
elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the
corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what
returns of members they pleased.

There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of
the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of
mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and
tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn.
The Queen-Consort sat under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain
the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.

6th March, 1685. Lent preachers continued as formerly in the Royal
Chapel.

7th March, 1685. My daughter, Mary, was taken with smallpox, and there
soon was found no hope of her recovery. A great affliction to me: but
God's holy will be done!

10th March, 1685. She received the blessed sacrament; after which,
disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she
bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and
piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind. She
died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to
our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best
quality, greatest and most virtuous persons. The justness of her
stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion,
unaffected, though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the least of her
ornaments compared with those of her mind. Of early piety, singularly
religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading,
and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of
common-place, as out of Dr. Hammond on the New Testament, and most of
the best practical treatises. She had read and digested a considerable
deal of history, and of places. The French tongue was as familiar to her
as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable
account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful
memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet
reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which
she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best
quality, she thereby improved. She had an excellent voice, to which she
played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to
that perfection, that of the scholars of those two famous masters,
Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the
sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness
to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she
sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note,
because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord
Arundel's, at Wardour.

What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and
agreeableness of her humor? condescending to the meanest servant in the
family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride.
She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody. Piety
was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that
even among equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately
acquainted, but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of
devotion; she had one or two confidants with whom she used to pass whole
days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly
communion, and other solemn occasions. She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and
ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play,
but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them,
and the time spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity. She never
played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but
this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she
could name a fault.

No one could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as
she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that
maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of
expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have
astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written. She had
a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be
decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master
say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save
in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described. Nothing affected, but natural and
easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always
material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her
tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming. Nothing was so
pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would
caress and humor with great delight. But she most affected to be with
grave and sober men, of whom she might learn something, and improve
herself. I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me;
comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some
excess, had I not sometimes repressed it.

Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would
willingly have spent whole days, for as I said she had read abundance of
history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems; she could compose
happily and put in pretty symbols, as in the "_Mundus Muliebris_,"
wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and
ornaments belonging to the sex. But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most
dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with
great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well
pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant
course of piety. Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part
with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and
reluctancy of a tender parent! Thy affection, duty and love to me was
that of a friend as well as a child. Nor less dear to thy mother, whose
example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to
her less conspicuous. Oh! how she mourns thy loss! how desolate hast
thou left us! To the grave shall we both carry thy memory! God alone (in
whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!) give us to resign thee and all
our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed
pleasure! Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to
bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious
and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening
through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with
thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee,
glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity! Amen.

It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness happened to her.
An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it
in particular, which struck her but two days before she came home, by an
imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who,
after they had been a good while in the house, told them she has a
servant sick of the smallpox (who indeed died the next day): this my
poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits. There were
four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and
I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion. She showed
great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never
would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God,
above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the
vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and
but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient
for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you
design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family. This
was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed
from an extraordinary child, and one who loved her parents beyond
example.

At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being
there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our
neighbor (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an
affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the
city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her
accompany my Lady, and staying some time with her; it was with the
greatest reluctance I complied. While she was there, my Lord being
musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I
was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of
Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching.
It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the
Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the
vain and empty conversation of the town, the theaters, the court, and
trifling visits which consumed so much precious time, and made her
sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the
greatest satisfaction. She was weary of this life, and I think went not
thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her.
She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed
one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, one of the Queen's women of
the bedchamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of
that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there
was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a
maid of honor to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy. But this she
did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much as the
service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve
herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was
arrived at so great a measure.

This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child,
whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more
durable than brass and marble. Precious is the memorial of the just.
Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I
ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things
worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me. Never
can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to
me!

This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in
which I first drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there
in the great sickness that year upon the first of that month, and the
very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.

[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

16th March, 1685. She was interred in the southeast end of the church at
Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and
relations. My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my
own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life,
but some circumstances did not permit it. Our vicar, Dr. Holden,
preached her funeral sermon on Phil. i. 21. "For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse,
as those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not to be
present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and
signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers.
I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be
spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people.

Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person, others
sending their coaches, of which there were six or seven with six horses,
viz, the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir
Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others. There
were distributed among her friends about sixty rings.

Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her
sex and of my poor family! God Almighty of his infinite mercy grant me
the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health and comfort to
my family: "teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to
wisdom," be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit! Amen!

On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of
collections she had made from historians, poets, travelers, etc., but,
above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these
contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically
disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions,
with many pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not named)
to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not
despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but
beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults,
imploring his assistance and spiritual directions. I well remember she
had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not
think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing
the great innocency and integrity of her life.

It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial and
practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially
music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving
visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she
has left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume a
world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet
abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation. But she was a little
miracle while she lived, and so she died!

26th March, 1685. I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that
excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the
Dutch war. He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier
of Calais. This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now
King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when
she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident
he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the
vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason
satisfaction. He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we
have few such seamen left.

8th April, 1685. Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction,
I went to London to hear Dr. Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent)
at Whitehall. I observed that though the King was not in his seat above
in the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which they were not
used to do when the late King was absent, making then one bowing only. I
asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do. The
Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair,
as if he had been present.

I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall to dwell at
Somerset House.

This day my brother of Wotton and Mr. Onslow were candidates for Surrey
against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were
circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking
advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of
Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being
tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they
expecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured. The Duke of Norfolk led
Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party. For this Parliament,
very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks,
and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the
country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it
by the trick above mentioned. Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could
not hear one word. Sir Edward Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in
favor with his Majesty.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1685. I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr. Tillotson, Dean
of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles. ix. 18. I returned in the evening,
and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among the plotters for
poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and
surely I believed him guiltless.

14th April, 1685. According to my custom, I went to London to pass the
holy week.

17th April, 1685. GOOD FRIDAY. Dr. Tenison preached at the new church at
St. James, on 1 Cor. xvi. 22, upon the infinite love of God to us, which
he illustrated in many instances. The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated. The Lord make me thankful! In the afternoon, Dr. Sprat,
Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very
full of Lords, the two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament. I supped with
the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home.

23d April, 1685. Was the coronation of the King and Queen. The solemnity
was magnificent as is set forth in print. The Bishop of Ely preached;
but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.
However, the King begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of
much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and
country. Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.

3d May, 1685. A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn,
Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies.

7th May, 1685. I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such
a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the Papists, and
alarmed several Parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers
priests, noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's bench; but,
being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see the issue, considering
that it would be published. Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the
hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person
who had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily believe, had done
much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and
ill-grounded proceedings; while he was at first so unreasonably blown up
and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable.

Mr. Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of
excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing first against the
Dissenters in several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and
Trimmers, under the title of "Observator," which came out three or four
days every week, in which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of
England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several
passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially
now that nobody gave the least occasion.[59]

    [Footnote 59: In the first Dutch war, while Evelyn was one of the
    Commissioners for sick and wounded, L'Estrange in his "Gazette"
    mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war:
    whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the
    Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would
    visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required
    L'Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.]

10th May, 1685. The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly to have been
the first Parliament called by his Majesty, gave the excise and customs
to him and his successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making
eloquent speeches, and especially minding them of a speedy suppression
of those late desperate Field-Conventiclers who had done such unheard of
assassinations. In the meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in
England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places.
God grant a better issue of it than some expect!

16th May, 1685. Oates was sentenced to be whipped and pilloried with the
utmost severity.

21st May, 1685. I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William
Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the "MONASTICON" and other
learned works; he told me he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and
memory perfect. There was shown a draft of the exact shape and
dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned withal, together with
the jewels and pearls, their weight and value, which amounted to
£100,658 sterling, attested at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and
goldsmith who set them.

22d May, 1685. In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my
Lord Privy Seal to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his
Lordship next the bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both
for hearing and seeing. After a short space, came in the Queen and
Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the archbishops, at the side
of the House on the right hand of the throne. In the interim, divers of
the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths,
so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind
the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.,
renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed,
standing all the while. Then came in the King, the crown on his head,
and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full,
he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly
enough, to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament from the
moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the
concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and
his subjects; that he would confirm whatever he had said in his
declaration at the first Council concerning his opinion of the
principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend
and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established;
that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart
from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense of
the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this
assurance of his care of our religion (his word was YOUR religion) and
property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted
not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially
as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of
government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might
possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to
time only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments; but that
that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best
way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and
therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being
but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."

At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts. Then he acquainted
them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West
Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he
had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should
take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved,
not questioning the Parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he
desired; at which there followed another "_Vive le Roi_," and so his
Majesty retired.

So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand
committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the
revenue to his Majesty for life. Mr. Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were
obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being
legally returned; but no one seconded him. The truth is, there were many
of the new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in
the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon,
Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and
from the effect of the new charters changing the electors. It was
reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer
than fifteen charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector:
whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested,
they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that
though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people
before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery. By the printed list of
members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135 who had been in
former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford.

In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against two or three
young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only four or five days, of
being of age.

The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their
confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of
which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy.

Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at several places and
whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed
on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some
thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the
perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved. I chanced to pass just as execution
was doing on him. A strange revolution!

Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his
Majesty, as usual.

It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many
believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in
Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair
for that office. I gave him joy the morning before of his new honor, he
having always been very civil to me.

24th May, 1685. We had hitherto not any rain for many months, so as the
caterpillars had already devoured all the winter fruit through the whole
land, and even killed several greater old trees. Such two winters and
summers I had never known.

4th June, 1685. Came to visit and take leave of me Sir Gabriel Sylvius,
now going Envoy-extraordinary into Denmark, with his secretary and
chaplain, a Frenchman, who related the miserable persecution of the
Protestants in France; not above ten churches left them, and those also
threatened to be demolished; they were commanded to christen their
children within twenty-four hours after birth, or else a Popish priest
was to be called, and then the infant brought up in Popery. In some
places, they were thirty leagues from any minister, or opportunity of
worship. This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of
the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations. There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord
Godolphin's little son, my charge. I brought them to the water side
where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London.

14th June, 1685. There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of
Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his
standard as King of England. I pray God deliver us from the confusion
which these beginnings threaten!

Such a dearth for want of rain was never in my memory.

17th June, 1685. The Duke landed with but 150 men; but the whole kingdom
was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the
trained bands flocking to him. At his landing, he published a
Declaration, charging his Majesty with usurpation and several horrid
crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering to call a free
Parliament. This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the
Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of £5,000 to any who should kill
him.

At this time, the words engraved on the monument in London, intimating
that the Papists fired the city, were erased and cut out.

The exceeding drought still continues.

18th June, 1685. I received a warrant to send out a horse with twelve
days' provisions, etc.

28th June, 1685. We had now plentiful rain after two years' excessive
drought and severe winters.

Argyle taken in Scotland, and executed, and his party dispersed.

2d July, 1685. No considerable account of the troops sent against the
Duke, though great forces sent. There was a smart skirmish; but he would
not be provoked to come to an encounter, but still kept in the
fastnesses.

Dangerfield whipped, like Oates, for perjury.

8th July, 1685. Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat, and the next day
of his being taken by Sir William Portman and Lord Lumley with the
militia of their counties. It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey,
being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short
a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as
when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him
a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse,
breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey,
leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of 2,000. The
whole number reported to be above 8,000; the King's but 2,700. The slain
were most of them MENDIP-MINERS, who did great execution with their
tools, and sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying were
pursued and taken the next morning, not far from one another. Monmouth
had gone sixteen miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and
was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but
without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some
countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be
known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.
It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak. Grey was
taken not far from him. Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor
cloth workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to
him. The arch-_boutefeu_, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet found.
The £5,000 to be given to whoever should bring Monmouth in, was to be
distributed among the militia by agreement between Sir William Portman
and Lord Lumley. The battle ended, some words, first in jest, then in
passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to
Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and one
Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one another.
Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of
those who knew him. He was Sir John's only son.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th July, 1685. Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a
little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near his
Majesty's bedchamber door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a
rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a
time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at first took little
notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he
reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said
yes, he meant his Lordship. My Lord told him he was no excluder (as
indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he
lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord
returned, and felled him. They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to
be carried to the Greencloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as
he deserved. My Lord Devon had nothing said to him.

I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr. Elias Ashmole's,
with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St. Asaph, and Dr. Tenison, when
we were treated at a great feast.

10th July, 1685. The Count of Castel Mellor, that great favorite and
prime minister of Alphonso, late King of Portugal, after several years'
banishment, being now received to grace and called home by Don Pedro,
the present King, as having been found a person of the greatest
integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to spend part of this day
with him, and assist him in a collection of books and other curiosities,
which he would carry with him into Portugal.

Mr. Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my late dear child, but
whom she could not bring herself to answer in affection, died now of the
same cruel disease, for which I was extremely sorry, because he never
enjoyed himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I averse to the
match, could she have overcome her disinclination.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th July, 1685. I went to see Dr. Tenison's library [in St. Martin's].

Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King,
to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by
Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain. He was sent to the
Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly,
having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two
years. He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his
last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to
administer the Holy Communion to him. For the rest of his faults he
professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear. He would
not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the
fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave
him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off;
which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away,
they would have torn him to pieces.

The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower Hill), but
gave a paper containing not above five or six lines, for the King, in
which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late
King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so
desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children. This relation I
had from Dr. Tenison (Rector of St. Martin's), who, with the Bishops of
Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.

Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies,
being extremely handsome and adroit, an excellent soldier and dancer, a
favorite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by
crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and
taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a
party of discontented men. He failed and perished.

He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought
him great riches, and a second dukedom in Scotland. He was Master of the
Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end. See what ambition and want of principles
brought him to! He was beheaded on Tuesday, 14th of July. His mother,
whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a
beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably
without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe
that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery! And
to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one Sidney who was
familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be
so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy
Councillors' attestation.[60]

    [Footnote 60: The "Life of James II." contains an account of the
    circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in
    illustration of the statements of the text. Ross, tutor to the Duke
    of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign
    a certificate of the King's marriage to Mrs. Barlow, though her own
    name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused. She was born of a
    gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace,
    came to London to make her fortune. Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel
    in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her fifty broad pieces (as he
    told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his
    regiment, he missed his bargain. She went into Holland, where she
    fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept
    her for some time, till the King hearing of her, got her from him.
    On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is
    already sped; and, after being with the King, she was so soon with
    child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and
    the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the
    Colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face.
    However, the King owned the child. In the King's absence she behaved
    so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would
    have no further commerce with her, and she became a common
    prostitute at Paris.]

Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there
would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would
have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity. For my
own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal. Such an
inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have
caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and
confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end. Blessed be
God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity
for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!

18th July, 1685. I went to see the muster of the six Scotch and English
regiments whom the Prince of Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out
of Holland upon this rebellion, but which were now returning, there
having been no occasion for their use. They were all excellently clad
and well disciplined, and were encamped on Blackheath with their tents:
the King and Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner of their
encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.

By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had
been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary
to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it,
it was prevented.

The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into the county troops,
were now come home, after a month's being out to our great charge.

20th July, 1685. The Trinity Company met this day, which should have
been on the Monday after Trinity, but was put off by reason of the Royal
Charter being so large, that it could not be ready before. Some
immunities were superadded. Mr. Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, was a
second time chosen Master. There were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Dartmouth, Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy, and
Brethren of the Corporation. We went to church, according to custom, and
then took barge to the Trinity House, in London, where we had a great
dinner, above eighty at one table.

[Sidenote: CHELSEA]

7th August, 1685. I went to see Mr. Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries'
garden of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree
bearing Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in quartan agues.
What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove
under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors
and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.

15th August, 1685. Came to visit us Mr. Boscawen, with my Lord
Godolphin's little son, with whose education hitherto his father had
intrusted me.

27th August, 1685. My daughter Elizabeth died of the smallpox, soon
after having married a young man, nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor
of the Navy, and one of the Commissioners. The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford. Thus, in less than six months were we deprived
of two children for our unworthiness and causes best known to God, whom
I beseech from the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to make
that right use of all these chastisements, that we may become better,
and entirely submit in all things to his infinitely wise disposal. Amen!

3d September, 1685. Lord Clarendon (Lord Privy Seal) wrote to let me
know that the King being pleased to send him Lord-Lieutenant into
Ireland, was also pleased to nominate me one of the Commissioners to
execute the office of Privy Seal during his Lieutenancy there, it
behoving me to wait upon his Majesty to give him thanks for this great
honor.

5th September, 1685. I accompanied his Lordship to Windsor (dining by
the way of Sir Henry Capel's at Kew), where his Majesty receiving me
with extraordinary kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible
I was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would endeavor to
serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my
duty than inclination. He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had
the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me. After this, came
abundance of great men to give me joy.

6th September, 1685. SUNDAY. I went to prayer in the chapel, and heard
Dr. Standish. The second sermon was preached by Dr. Creighton, on 1
Thess. iv. 11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of our
own business, according to the advice of the apostle. Then I went to
hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St. George's Hall. Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew
to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art
and invention, deserve the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor
Verrio. The history is Edward III. receiving the Black Prince, coming
toward him in a Roman triumph. The whole roof is the history of St.
George. The throne, the carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think
equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen
abroad.

I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir William Soames,
designed Ambassador to Constantinople.

About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and
brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at
his house in Oxfordshire. The King went immediately to council;
everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice
Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now
gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in
several counties, and was now near upon his return. I took my leave of
his Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping that night at
Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.

15th September, 1685. I accompanied Mr. Pepys to Portsmouth, whither his
Majesty was going the first time since his coming to the Crown, to see
in what state the fortifications were. We took coach and six horses,
late after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night. While supper was
making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs. Graham, some time maid of
honor to the Queen Dowager, now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy
purse to the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a little
quarter of a mile from Bagshot town. Very importunate she was that I
would sup, and abide there that night; but, being obliged by my
companion, I returned to our inn, after she had shown me her house,
which was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an excellent
housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady. There is a park full of red deer
about it. Her eldest son was now sick there of the smallpox, but in a
likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might
while young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one
time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this
cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she
affirmed.

[Sidenote: WINCHESTER]

16th September, 1685. The next morning, setting out early, we arrived
soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the
Dean's (Dr. Meggot). I found very few with him besides my Lords
Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells. His Majesty
was discoursing with the bishops concerning miracles, and what strange
things the Saludadors[61] would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their
mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which
his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of
miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to
see one himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a
delusion of his senses. Then they spoke of the boy who was pretended to
have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr. de Santa
Clara and others. To all of which the Bishop added a great miracle
happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor, miserably
sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized) who
immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of
King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing one that was
blind.

    [Footnote 61: Evelyn subjoins this note:--"As to that of the
    Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly
    as Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr. Pepys
    passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth
    of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous
    one at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would
    make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before
    him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more
    than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so
    acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that
    what they pretended was all a cheat, which he would easily discover,
    though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet
    have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their
    jugglings. This Mr. Pepys affirmed to me; but said he, I did not
    conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what
    they pretended to do.

    J. E."]

There was something said of the second sight happening to some persons,
especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told
us that Monsieur ... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly
cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, "_Voilà Monsieur comme il
entre sans tete!_" Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had
effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Savior's
cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching. And
speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St.
Edward the Confessor at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as
the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a
hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it
to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in
mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during
his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket. "I had thought," said
the King, "it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet
that his Majesty would have me secure"; but, says he, "you will remember
that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was
pleased to put it into my hand. It was of gold, about three inches long,
having on one side a crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty broad table
amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within
was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a
Latin inscription in gold and Roman letters. More company coming in,
this discourse ended. I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty
made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at
Windsor or Whitehall, that the negroes in the plantations should all be
baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters
prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be _ipso
facto_ free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them
christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for.

I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought
almost to the covering. It is placed on the side of the hill, where
formerly stood the old castle. It is a stately fabric, of three sides
and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone. It was intended for a
hunting-house when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an
incomparable prospect. I believe there had already been £20,000 and more
expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it
at least for a while.

Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair. There
are still the coffins of the six Saxon Kings, whose bones had been
scattered by the sacrilegious rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose,
of finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up again and put
into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir.

[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

17th September, 1685. Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth,
something before his Majesty arrived. We found all the road full of
people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King
pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way. The
Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were
standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town,
where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort
were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come
into Portsmouth. All the soldiers (near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining
the streets and platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's
residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and
shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir ...
Slingsby, the Lieutenant Governor, all the gentlemen in his train
sitting down at table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to
dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous
and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.

After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on
his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the house where he dined, and then
having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for
Winchester, whither he returned that night. This hall is artificially
hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor.
Hence, to see the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.

Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay. There
were now thirty-two men-of-war in the harbor. I was invited by Sir R.
Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr. Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where
we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London.

I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, etc., many
years since. I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially
about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a
very fierce commander in the first Rebellion. His house is large, and
standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth.

By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in
his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as
to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be
nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of
the national religion.

30th September, 1685. Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of
Ireland was sealed this day.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1685. Having a letter sent me by Mr. Pepys with this
expression at the foot of it, "I have something to show you that I may
not have another time," and that I would not fail to dine with him. I
accordingly went. After dinner, he had me and Mr. Houblon (a rich and
considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the
persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that
being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all
along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, etc.,
till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his
inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing
his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself. There
are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives
dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not
so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make
use of it. INDEED, he said, as to SOME MATRIMONIAL CASES, THERE ARE NOW
AND THEN DISPENSATIONS, but hardly in any cases else.

This familiar discourse encouraged Mr. Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if
he might ask it without offense, and for that his Majesty could not but
observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had
been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his
Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which
did not befit him to look into. The King ingenuously told him that he
both was and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long since
declared that it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to
himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that
persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a
cabinet, he showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several
arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging
her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the
chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the
primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was
that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely
our Savior would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to
resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned
as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put
together by the late King yet written all with his own hand, blotted and
interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they
might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to
time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking
on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be
without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe. When his Majesty
had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of
these two papers, attested at the bottom in four or five lines under his
own hand.

These were the papers I saw and read. This nice and curious passage I
thought fit to set down. Though all the arguments and objections were
altogether weak, and have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if
nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that,
no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St. Peter's
successors' unerring dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it. Here
all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference
implied.

I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was
to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indifference, neglect,
and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects
only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great
advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and
great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane. God
was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and unprosperous, by
wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the
public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious
Court had brought into credit. I think of it with sorrow and pity, when
I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what
opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to that Church for
which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful
to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a
religion; had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he should have
done, not only for the good of his kingdom, but of all the Reformed
Churches in christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our
remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and
destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of. The consequence of
this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further. The
emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till
they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be
able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but
lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments,
antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God,
for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the
profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most
confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be
extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of
the world. I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion,
which I forbear to mention here.

In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr. Pepys, and
those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and
ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment
upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he makes a conscience
of what he promises, to perform it. In this confidence, I hope that the
Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands)
to flourish also. In all events, whatever does become of the Church of
England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth,
the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.

8th October, 1685. I had my picture drawn this week by the famous
Kneller.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th October, 1685. I went to London about finishing my lodgings at
Whitehall.

15th October, 1685. Being the King's birthday, there was a solemn ball
at Court, and before it music of instruments and voices. I happened by
accident to stand the very next to the Queen and the King, who talked
with me about the music.

18th October, 1685. The King was now building all that range from east
to west by the court and garden to the street, and making a new chapel
for the Queen, whose lodgings were to be in this new building, as also a
new Council chamber and offices next the south end of the banqueting
house. I returned home, next morning, to London.

22d October, 1685. I accompanied my Lady Clarendon to her house at
Swallowfield, in Berks, dining by the way at Mr. Graham's lodge at
Bagshot; the house, newly repaired and capacious enough for a good
family, stands in a park.

Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the ancient
building of honorable gentlemen's houses, when they kept up ancient
hospitality, but the gardens and waters as elegant as it is possible to
make a flat by art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being so
extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord in diligence of
planting; so that I have hardly seen a seat which shows more tokens of
it than what is to be found here, not only in the delicious and rarest
fruits of a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the ground
about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit of the place. There
is one orchard of 1,000 golden, and other cider pippins; walks and
groves of elms, limes, oaks, and other trees. The garden is so beset
with all manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air. The
distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is excellent.
The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most desirable plants; two
very noble orangeries well furnished: but, above all, the canal and fish
ponds, the one fed with a white, the other with a black running water,
fed by a quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with
fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw anything
approaching it. We had at every meal carp and pike of a size fit for the
table of a Prince, and what added to the delight was, to see the
hundreds taken by the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we
pointed out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would have been
worth at London twenty shillings a piece. The waters are flagged about
with _Calámus aromaticus_, with which my lady has hung a closet, that
retains the smell very perfectly. There is also a certain sweet willow
and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green, meadow, pasture, and
wood; in a word, all that can render a country seat delightful. There is
besides a well-furnished library in the house.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1685. We returned to London, having been treated with all
sorts of cheer and noble freedom by that most religious and virtuous
lady. She was now preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made
Lord Deputy, and went to this country house and ancient seat of her
father and family, to set things in order during her absence; but never
were good people and neighbors more concerned than all the country (the
poor especially) for the departure of this charitable woman; everyone
was in tears, and she as unwilling to part from them. There was among
them a maiden of primitive life, the daughter of a poor laboring man,
who had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by her labor, and
has for many years refused marriage, or to receive any assistance from
the parish, besides the little hermitage my lady gives her rent-free;
she lives on four pence a day, which she gets by spinning; says she
abounds and can give alms to others, living in great humility and
content, without any apparent affectation, or singularity; she is
continually working, praying, or reading, gives a good account of her
knowledge in religion, visits the sick; is not in the least given to
talk; very modest, of a simple not unseemingly behavior; of a comely
countenance, clad very plain, but clean and tight. In sum, she appears a
saint of an extraordinary sort, in so religious a life, as is seldom met
with in villages now-a-days.

27th October, 1685. I was invited to dine at Sir Stephen Fox's with my
Lord Lieutenant, where was such a dinner for variety of all things as I
had seldom seen, and it was so for the trial of a master-cook whom Sir
Stephen had recommended to go with his Lordship into Ireland; there were
all the dainties not only of the season, but of what art could add,
venison, plain solid meat, fowl, baked and boiled meats, banquet
[dessert], in exceeding plenty, and exquisitely dressed. There also
dined my Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter), my Lady
Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.

28th October, 1685. At the Royal Society, an urn full of bones was
presented, dug up in a highway, while repairing it, in a field in
Camberwell, in Surrey; it was found entire with its cover, among many
others, believed to be truly Roman and ancient.

Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a chariot he had
invented, which it was not possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way
it was drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in
that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some
inconveniences yet to be remedied--it would not contain more than one
person; was ready to take fire every ten miles; and being placed and
playing on no fewer than ten rollers, it made a most prodigious noise,
almost intolerable. A remedy was to be sought for these inconveniences.

31st October, 1685. I dined at our great Lord Chancellor Jefferies', who
used me with much respect. This was the late Chief-Justice who had newly
been the Western Circuit to try the Monmouth conspirators, and had
formerly done such severe justice among the obnoxious in Westminster
Hall, for which his Majesty dignified him by creating him first a Baron,
and now Lord Chancellor. He had some years past been conversant in
Deptford; is of an assured and undaunted spirit, and has served the
Court interest on all the hardiest occasions; is of nature cruel, and a
slave of the Court.

3d November, 1685. The French persecution of the Protestants raging
with the utmost barbarity, exceeded even what the very heathens used:
innumerable persons of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their
earthly substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed
through all the countries of Europe. The French tyrant abrogated the
Edict of Nantes which had been made in favor of them, and without any
cause; on a sudden demolishing all their churches, banishing,
imprisoning, and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering
the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of barbarous usage by
soldiers sent to ruin and prey on them; taking away their children;
forcing people to the Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they
burnt their libraries, pillaged their goods, ate up their fields and
substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys, and seized on
their estates. There had now been numbered to pass through Geneva only
(and that by stealth, for all the usual passages were strictly guarded
by sea and land) 40,000 toward Switzerland. In Holland, Denmark, and all
about Germany, were dispersed some hundred thousands; besides those in
England, where, though multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and
welcome as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least
encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen into, and the
uncharitable indifference of such as should have embraced them; and I
prey it be not laid to our charge. The famous Claude fled to Holland;
Allix and several more came to London, and persons of great estates came
over, who had forsaken all. France was almost dispeopled, the bankers so
broken, that the tyrant's revenue was exceedingly diminished,
manufactures ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred
what was done, nor did the Papists themselves approve it. What the
further intention is, time will show; but doubtless portending some
revolution.

I was shown the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia on Rhone made in
the name of the Clergy, celebrating the French King, as if he was a God,
for persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in it, "That
as his victory over heresy was greater than all the conquests of
Alexander and Cæsar, it was but what was wished in England; and that God
seemed to raise the French King to this power and magnanimous action,
that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same here." This
paragraph is very bold and remarkable; several reflecting on Archbishop
Usher's prophecy as now begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in
all other reformed churches. One thing was much taken notice of, that
the "Gazettes" which were still constantly printed twice a week,
informing us what was done all over Europe, never spoke of this
wonderful proceeding in France; nor was any relation of it published by
any, save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives brought.
Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture; but it appeared very
extraordinary in a Protestant country that we should know nothing of
what Protestants suffered, while great collections were made for them in
foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1685. It being an extraordinarily wet morning, and myself
indisposed by a very great rheum, I did not go to church, to my very
great sorrow, it being the first Gunpowder Conspiracy anniversary that
had been kept now these eighty years under a prince of the Roman
religion. Bonfires were forbidden on this day; what does this portend!

9th November, 1685. Began the Parliament. The King in his speech
required continuance of a standing force instead of a militia, and
indemnity and dispensation to Popish officers from the Test; demands
very unexpected and unpleasing to the Commons. He also required a supply
of revenue, which they granted; but returned no thanks to the King for
his speech, till farther consideration.

12th November, 1685. The Commons postponed finishing the bill for the
Supply, to consider the Test, and Popish officers; this was carried but
by one voice.

14th November, 1685. I dined at Lambeth, my Lord Archbishop carrying me
with him in his barge; there were my Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Bishops
of Ely and St. Asaph, Dr. Sherlock, and other divines; Sir William
Hayward, Sir Paul Rycaut, etc.

20th November, 1685. The Parliament was adjourned to February, several
both of Lords and Commons excepting against some passage of his
Majesty's speech relating to the Test, and continuance of Popish
officers in command. This was a great surprise in a Parliament which
people believed would have complied in all things.

Popish pamphlets and pictures sold publicly; no books nor answers to
them appearing till long after.

21st November, 1685. I resigned my trust for composing a difference
between Mr. Thynn and his wife.

22d November, 1685. Hitherto was a very wet, warm season.

4th December, 1685. Lord Sunderland was declared President of the
Council, and yet to hold his Secretary's place. The forces disposed into
several quarters through the kingdom are very insolent, on which are
great complaints.

Lord Brandon, tried for the late conspiracy, was condemned and pardoned;
so was Lord Grey, his accuser and witness.

Persecution in France raging, the French insolently visit our vessels,
and take away the fugitive Protestants; some escape in barrels.

[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

10th December, 1685. To Greenwich, being put into the new Commission of
Sewers.

13th December, 1685. Dr. Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Whitehall, before the Princess of Denmark, who, since his Majesty came
to the Crown, always sat in the King's closet, and had the same bowings
and ceremonies applied to the place where she was, as his Majesty had
when there in person.

Dining at Mr. Pepys's, Dr. Slayer showed us an experiment of a wonderful
nature, pouring first a very cold liquor into a glass, and superfusing
on it another, to appearance cold and clear liquor also; it first
produced a white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual
flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little shaken
together, fixed divers suns and stars of real fire, perfectly globular,
on the sides of the glass, and which there stuck like so many
constellations, burning most vehemently, and resembling stars and
heavenly bodies, and that for a long space. It seemed to exhibit a
theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and the fixing or
gathering of the universal light into luminous bodies. This matter, or
phosphorus, was made out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital
flame, or heat in animal bodies. A very noble experiment!

16th December, 1685. I accompanied my Lord-Lieutenant as far as St.
Alban's, there going out of town with him near 200 coaches of all the
great officers and nobility. The next morning taking leave, I returned
to London.

18th December, 1685. I dined at the great entertainment his Majesty gave
the Venetian Ambassadors, Signors Zenno and Justiniani, accompanied with
ten more noble Venetians of their most illustrious families, Cornaro,
Maccenigo, etc., who came to congratulate their Majesties coming to the
Crown. The dinner was most magnificent and plentiful, at four tables,
with music, kettledrums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle at
every health. The banquet [dessert] was twelve vast chargers piled up so
high that those who sat one against another could hardly see each other.
Of these sweetmeats, which doubtless were some days piling up in that
exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but leaving them to the
spectators who came out of curiosity to see the dinner, were exceedingly
pleased to see in what a moment of time all that curious work was
demolished, the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared. Thus his
Majesty entertained them three days, which (for the table only) cost him
£600, as the Clerk of the Greencloth (Sir William Boreman) assured me.
Dinner ended, I saw their procession, or cavalcade, to Whitehall,
innumerable coaches attending. The two Ambassadors had four coaches of
their own, and fifty footmen (as I remember), besides other equipage as
splendid as the occasion would permit, the Court being still in
mourning. Thence, I went to the audience which they had in the Queen's
presence chamber, the Banqueting House being full of goods and furniture
till the galleries on the garden-side, council chamber, and new chapel,
now in the building, were finished. They went to their audience in those
plain black gowns and caps which they constantly wear in the city of
Venice. I was invited to have accompanied the two Ambassadors in their
coach to supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings, as no
longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I excused myself.

19th December, 1685. My Lord Treasurer made me dine with him, where I
became acquainted with Monsieur Barillon, the French Ambassador, a
learned and crafty advocate.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th December, 1685. Dr. Turner, brother to the Bishop of Ely, and
sometime tutor to my son, preached at Whitehall on Mark viii. 38,
concerning the submission of Christians to their persecutors, in which
were some passages indiscreet enough, considering the time, and the rage
of the inhuman French tyrant against the poor Protestants.

22d December, 1685. Our patent for executing the office of Privy Seal
during the absence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, being this day
sealed by the Lord Chancellor, we went afterward to St. James, where the
Court then was on occasion of building at Whitehall; his Majesty
delivered the seal to my Lord Tiviot and myself, the other Commissioners
not being come, and then gave us his hand to kiss. There were the two
Venetian Ambassadors and a world of company; among the rest the first
Popish Nuncio that had been in England since the Reformation; so
wonderfully were things changed, to the universal jealousy.

24th December, 1685. We were all three Commissioners sworn on our knees
by the Clerk of the Crown, before my Lord Chancellor, three several
oaths: allegiance, supremacy, and the oath belonging to the Lord Privy
Seal, which last we took standing. After this, the Lord Chancellor
invited us all to dinner, but it being Christmas eve we desired to be
excused, intending at three in the afternoon to seal divers things which
lay ready at the office; so attended by three of the Clerks of the
Signet, we met and sealed. Among other things was a pardon to West, who
being privy to the late conspiracy, had revealed the accomplices to save
his own neck. There were also another pardon and two indenizations; and
so agreeing to a fortnight's vacation, I returned home.

31st December, 1685. Recollecting the passages of the year past, and
having made up accounts, humbly besought Almighty God to pardon those my
sins which had provoked him to discompose my sorrowful family; that he
would accept of our humiliation, and in his good time restore comfort to
it. I also blessed God for all his undeserved mercies and preservations,
begging the continuance of his grace and preservation. The winter had
hitherto been extraordinarily wet and mild.

1st January, 1685-6. Imploring the continuance of God's providential
care for the year now entered, I went to the public devotions. The Dean
of the Chapel and Clerk of the Closet put out, viz, Bishop of London and
..., and Rochester and Durham put in their places; the former had
opposed the toleration intended, and shown a worthy zeal for the
reformed religion as established.

6th January, 1686. I dined with the Archbishop of York, where was Peter
Walsh, that Romish priest so well known for his moderation, professing
the Church of England to be a true member of the Catholic Church. He is
used to go to our public prayers without scruple, and did not
acknowledge the Pope's infallibility, only primacy of order.

19th January, 1686. Passed the Privy Seal, among others, the creation of
Mrs. Sedley (concubine to ----) Countess of Dorchester, which the Queen
took very grievously, so as for two dinners, standing near her, I
observed she hardly ate one morsel, nor spoke one word to the King, or
to any about her, though at other times she used to be extremely
pleasant, full of discourse and good humor. The Roman Catholics were
also very angry: because they had so long valued the sanctity of their
religion and proselytes.

Dryden, the famous playwriter, and his two sons, and Mrs. Nelly (miss to
the late ----), were said to go to mass; such proselytes were no great
loss to the Church.

This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's palace in
Bloomsbury, than which for painting and furniture there was nothing more
glorious in England. This happened by the negligence of a servant
airing, as they call it, some of the goods by the fire in a moist
season; indeed, so wet and mild a season had scarce been seen in man's
memory.

At this Seal there also passed the creation of Sir Henry Waldegrave to
be a Peer. He had married one of the King's natural daughters by Mrs.
Churchill. These two Seals my brother Commissioners passed in the
morning before I came to town, at which I was not displeased. We
likewise passed Privy Seals for £276,000 upon several accounts,
pensions, guards, wardrobes, privy purse, etc., besides divers pardons,
and one more which I must not forget (and which by Providence I was not
present at) one Mr. Lytcott to be Secretary to the Ambassador to Rome.
We being three Commissioners, any two were a quorum.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1686. I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager, at Somerset House, where dined the Countesses of
Devonshire, Dover, etc.; in all eleven ladies of quality, no man but
myself being there.

24th January, 1686. Unheard-of cruelties to the persecuted Protestants
of France, such as hardly any age has seen the like, even among the
Pagans.

6th February, 1686. Being the day on which his Majesty began his reign,
by order of Council it was to be solemnized with a particular office and
sermon, which the Bishop of Ely preached at Whitehall on Numb. xi. 12; a
Court oration upon the regal office. It was much wondered at, that this
day, which was that of his late Majesty's death, should be kept as a
festival, and not the day of the present King's coronation. It is said
to have been formerly the custom, though not till now since the reign of
King James I.

The Duchess of Monmouth, being in the same seat with me at church,
appeared with a very sad and afflicted countenance.

8th February, 1686. I took the test in Westminster Hall, before the Lord
Chief Justice. I now came to lodge at Whitehall, in the Lord Privy
Seal's lodgings.

12th February, 1686. My great cause was heard by my Lord Chancellor, who
granted me a rehearing. I had six eminent lawyers, my antagonist three,
whereof one was the smooth-tongued solicitor, whom my Lord Chancellor
reproved in great passion for a very small occasion. Blessed be God for
his great goodness to me this day!

19th February, 1686. Many bloody and notorious duels were fought about
this time. The Duke of Grafton killed Mr. Stanley, brother to the Earl
of [Derby], indeed upon an almost insufferable provocation. It is to be
hoped that his Majesty will at last severely remedy this unchristian
custom.

Lord Sunderland was now Secretary of State, President of the Council,
and Premier Minister.

1st March, 1686. Came Sir Gilbert Gerrard to treat with me about his
son's marrying my daughter, Susanna. The father being obnoxious, and in
some suspicion and displeasure of the King, I would receive no proposal
till his Majesty had given me leave; which he was pleased to do; but,
after several meetings we broke off, on his not being willing to secure
anything competent for my daughter's children; besides that I found most
of his estate was in the coal-pits as far off as Newcastle, and on
leases from the Bishop of Durham, who had power to make concurrent
leases, with other difficulties.

7th March, 1686. Dr. Frampton, Bishop of Gloucester, preached on Psalm
xliv. 17, 18, 19, showing the several afflictions of the Church of
Christ from the primitive to this day, applying exceedingly to the
present conjuncture, when many were wavering in their minds, and great
temptations appearing through the favor now found by the Papists, so as
the people were full of jealousies and discouragement. The Bishop
magnified the Church of England, exhorting to constancy and
perseverance.

10th March, 1686. A Council of the Royal Society about disposing of Dr.
Ray's book of Fishes, which was printed at the expense of the Society.

12th March, 1686. A docket was to be sealed, importing a lease of
twenty-one years to one Hall, who styled himself his Majesty's printer
(he lately turned Papist) for the printing missals, offices, lives of
saints, portals, primers, etc., books expressly forbidden to be printed
or sold, by divers Acts of Parliament; I refused to put my seal to it,
making my exceptions, so it was laid by.

14th March, 1686. The Bishop of Bath and Wells preached on John vi. 17,
a most excellent and pathetic discourse: after he had recommended the
duty of fasting and other penitential duties, he exhorted to constancy
in the Protestant religion, detestation of the unheard-of cruelties of
the French, and stirring up to a liberal contribution. This sermon was
the more acceptable, as it was unexpected from a Bishop who had
undergone the censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof
no man could show more. This indeed did all our Bishops, to the
disabusing and reproach of all their delators: for none were more
zealous against Popery than they were.

16th March, 1686. I was at a review of the army about London in Hyde
Park, about 6,000 horse and foot, in excellent order; his Majesty and
infinity of people being present.

17th March, 1686. I went to my house in the country, refusing to be
present at what was to pass at the Privy Seal the next day. In the
morning Dr. Tenison preached an incomparable discourse at Whitehall, on
Timothy ii. 3, 4.

24th March, 1686. Dr. Cradock (Provost of Eaton) preached at the same
place, on Psalm xlix. 13, showing the vanity of earthly enjoyments.

28th March, 1686. Dr. White, Bishop of Peterborough, preached in a very
eloquent style, on Matthew xxvi. 29, submission to the will of God on
all accidents, and at all times.

29th March, 1686. The Duke of Northumberland (a natural son of the late
King by the Duchess of Cleveland) marrying very meanly, with the help of
his brother Grafton, attempted in vain to spirit away his wife.

A Brief was read in all churches for relieving the French Protestants,
who came here for protection from the unheard-of cruelties of the King.

2d April, 1686. Sir Edward Hales, a Papist, made Governor of Dover
Castle.

15th April, 1686. The Archbishop of York now died of the smallpox, aged
62, a corpulent man. He was my special loving friend, and while Bishop
of Rochester (from whence he was translated) my excellent neighbor. He
was an inexpressible loss to the whole church, and that Province
especially, being a learned, wise, stout, and most worthy prelate; I
look on this as a great stroke to the poor Church of England, now in
this defecting period.

18th April, 1686. In the afternoon I went to Camberwell, to visit Dr.
Parr. After sermon, I accompanied him to his house, where he showed me
the Life and Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher), and
among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the Primate, giving
notice of the Popish practices to pervert this nation, by sending a
hundred priests into England, who were to conform themselves to all
sectaries and conditions for the more easily dispersing their doctrine
among us. This letter was the cause of the whole impression being
seized, upon pretense that it was a political or historical account of
things not relating to theology, though it had been licensed by the
Bishop; which plainly showed what an interest the Papists now had,--that
a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of so eminent a man,
was not to be published. There were also many letters to and from most
of the learned persons his correspondents in Europe. The book will, I
doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment.

Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones put in.

25th April, 1686. This day was read in our church the Brief for a
collection for relief of the Protestant French so cruelly, barbarously,
and inhumanly oppressed without any thing being laid to their charge. It
had been long expected, and at last with difficulty procured to be
published, the interest of the French Ambassador obstructing it.

5th May, 1686. There being a Seal, it was feared we should be required
to pass a docket dispensing with Dr. Obadiah Walker and four more,
whereof one was an apostate curate of Putney, the others officers of
University College, Oxford, who hold their masterships, fellowships, and
cures, and keep public schools, and enjoy all former emoluments,
notwithstanding they no more frequented or used the public forms of
prayers, or communion, with the Church of England, or took the Test or
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, contrary to twenty Acts of
Parliament; which dispensation being also contrary to his Majesty's own
gracious declaration at the beginning of his reign, gave umbrage (as
well it might) to every good Protestant; nor could we safely have passed
it under the Privy Seal, wherefore it was done by immediate warrant,
signed by Mr. Solicitor.

This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish life, to whose tuition I
had more than thirty years since recommended the sons of my worthy
friend, Mr. Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey, believing him to be far from
what he proved--a hypocritical concealed Papist--by which he perverted
the eldest son of Mr. Hyldyard, Sir Edward Hale's eldest son, and
several more, to the great disturbance of the whole nation, as well as
of the University, as by his now public defection appeared. All engines
being now at work to bring in Popery, which God in mercy prevent!

[Sidenote: LONDON]

This day was burned in the old Exchange, by the common hangman, a
translation of a book written by the famous Monsieur Claude, relating
only matters of fact concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous
proceedings of the French King against his Protestant subjects, without
any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a power and ascendant
here had the French Ambassador, who was doubtless in great indignation
at the pious and truly generous charity of all the nation, for the
relief of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter.

About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by the French King
to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont, slew many thousands of those
innocent people, so that there seemed to be an universal design to
destroy all that would not go to mass, throughout Europe. _Quod Avertat
D. O. M.!_ No faith in Princes!

12th May, 1686. I refused to put the Privy Seal to Doctor Walker's
license for printing and publishing divers Popish books, of which I
complained both to my Lord of Canterbury (with whom I went to advise in
the Council Chamber), and to my Lord Treasurer that evening at his
lodgings. My Lord of Canterbury's advice was, that I should follow my
own conscience therein; Mr. Treasurer's, that if in conscience I could
dispense with it, for any other hazard he believed there was none.
Notwithstanding this, I persisted in my refusal.

29th May, 1686. There was no sermon on this anniversary, as there
usually had been ever since the reign of the present King.

2d June, 1686. Such storms, rain, and foul weather, seldom known at this
time of the year. The camp at Hounslow Heath, from sickness and other
inconveniences of weather, forced to retire to quarters; the storms
being succeeded by excessive hot weather, many grew sick. Great feasting
there, especially in Lord Dunbarton's quarters. There were many
jealousies and discourses of what was the meaning of this encampment.

A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of Knight Baronets'
fees, which having been passed over for so many years, did greatly
disoblige several families who had served his Majesty. Lord Tyrconnel
gone to Ireland, with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause
of talk as the camp, especially nineteen new Privy-Councillors and
Judges being now made, among which but three Protestants, and Tyrconnel
made General.

New judges also here, among which was Milton, a Papist (brother to that
Milton who wrote for the Regicides), who presumed to take his place
without passing the Test. Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to
the Papists there.

The French persecution more inhuman than ever. The Protestants in Savoy
successfully resist the French dragoons sent to murder them.

The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing from the Protestant
religion, does of his own accord publish his recantation at Edinburg.

11th June, 1686. I went to see Middleton's receptacle of water at the
New River, and the New Spa Wells near.

20th June, 1686. An extraordinary season of violent and sudden rain. The
camp still in tents.

24th June, 1686. My Lord Treasurer settled my great business with Mr.
Pretyman, to which I hope God will at last give a prosperous issue.

25th June, 1686. Now his Majesty, beginning with Dr. Sharp and Tully,
proceeded to silence and suspend divers excellent divines for preaching
against Popery.

27th June, 1686. I had this day been married thirty-nine years--blessed
be God for all his mercies!

The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared on the bench,
that the government of England was entirely in the King; that the Crown
was absolute; that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable
the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to bind
the King's power; that he could pardon all offenses against the law, and
forgive the penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by which
the Test was abolished? Everyone was astonished. Great jealousies as to
what would be the end of these proceedings.

6th July, 1686. I supped with the Countess of Rochester, where was also
the Duchess of Buckingham and Madame de Governè, whose daughter was
married to the Marquis of Halifax's son. She made me a character of the
French King and Dauphin, and of the persecution; that they kept much of
the cruelties from the King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid
of his father, that he dared not let anything appear of his sentiments;
that he hated letters and priests, spent all his time in hunting, and
seemed to take no notice of what was passing.

This lady was of a great family and fortune, and had fled hither for
refuge.

8th July, 1686. I waited on the Archbishop at Lambeth, where I dined and
met the famous preacher and writer, Dr. Allix, doubtless a most
excellent and learned person. The Archbishop and he spoke Latin
together, and that very readily.

11th July, 1686. Dr. Meggot, Dean of Winchester preached before the
household in St. George's Chapel at Windsor, the late King's glorious
chapel now seized on by the mass priests. Dr. Cartwright, Dean of Ripon,
preached before the great men of the Court in the same place.

We had now the sad news of the Bishop of Oxford's death, an
extraordinary loss to the poor Church at this time. Many candidates for
his Bishopric and Deanery, Dr. Parker, South, Aldrich, etc. Dr. Walker
(now apostatizing) came to Court, and was doubtless very busy.

13th July, 1686. Note, that standing by the Queen at basset (cards), I
observed that she was exceedingly concerned for the loss of £80; her
outward affability much changed to stateliness, since she has been
exalted.

The season very rainy and inconvenient for the camps. His Majesty very
cheerful.

14th July, 1686. Was sealed at our office the constitution of certain
commissioners to take upon them full power of all Ecclesiastical
affairs, in as unlimited a manner, or rather greater, than the late High
Commission-Court, abrogated by Parliament; for it had not only faculty
to inspect and visit all Bishops' dioceses, but to change what laws and
statutes they should think fit to alter among the colleges, though
founded by private men; to punish, suspend, fine, etc., give oaths and
call witnesses. The main drift was to suppress zealous preachers. In
sum, it was the whole power of a Vicar-General--note the consequence! Of
the clergy the commissioners were the Archbishop of Canterbury
[Sancroft], Bishop of Durham [Crewe], and Rochester [Sprat]; of the
Temporals, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Chancellor [Jefferies] (who
alone was ever to be of the quorum), the Chief justice [Herbert], and
Lord President [Earl of Sunderland].

18th July, 1686. I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Greenwich.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th August, 1686. I dined at Signor Verrio's, the famous Italian
painter, now settled in his Majesty's garden at St. James's, which he
had made a very delicious paradise.

8th August, 1686. Our vicar gone to dispose of his country living in
Rutlandshire, having St. Dunstan in the east given him by the Archbishop
of Canterbury.

I went to visit the Marquis Ravigné, now my neighbor at Greenwich,
retired from the persecution in France. He was the deputy of all the
Protestants of that kingdom in the parliament of Paris, and several
times Ambassador in this and other Courts; a person of great learning
and experience.

8th September, 1686. Dr. Compton, Bishop of London, was on Monday
suspended, on pretense of not silencing Dr. Sharp at St. Giles's, for
something of a sermon in which he zealously reproved the doctrine of the
Roman Catholics. The Bishop having consulted the civilians, they told
him he could not by any law proceed against Dr. Sharp without producing
witnesses, and impleaded according to form; but it was overruled by my
Lord Chancellor, and the Bishop sentenced without so much as being heard
to any purpose. This was thought a very extraordinary way of proceeding,
and was universally resented, and so much the rather for that two
Bishops, Durham and Rochester, sitting in the commission and giving
their suffrages the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to sit among them.
He was only suspended _ab officio_, and that was soon after taken off.
He was brother to the Earl of Northampton, had once been a soldier, had
traveled in Italy, but became a sober, grave, and excellent prelate.

12th September, 1686. Buda now taken from the Turks; a form of
thanksgiving was ordered to be used in the (as yet remaining) Protestant
chapels and church of Whitehall and Windsor.

The King of Denmark was besieging Hamburg, no doubt by the French
contrivance, to embroil the Protestant Princes in a new war, that
Holland, etc., being engaged, matter for new quarrel might arise: the
unheard-of persecution of the poor Protestants still raging more than
ever.

22d September, 1686. The Danes retire from Hamburg, the Protestant
Princes appearing for their succor, and the Emperor sending his
minatories to the King of Denmark, and also requiring the restoration of
the Duke of Saxe Gotha. Thus it pleased God to defeat the French
designs, which were evidently to kindle a new war.

14th October, 1686. His Majesty's birthday; I was at his rising in his
bedchamber, afterward in the park, where four companies of guards were
drawn up. The officers, etc., wonderfully rich and gallant; they did not
head their troops, but their next officers, the colonels being on
horseback by the King while they marched. The ladies not less splendid
at Court, where there was a ball at night; but small appearance of
quality. All the shops both in the city and suburbs were shut up, and
kept as solemnly as any holiday. Bonfires at night in Westminster, but
forbidden in the city.

17th October, 1686. Dr. Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Covent Garden Church on Ephes. v. 18, 19, showing the custom of the
primitive saints in serving God with hymns, and their frequent use of
them upon all occasions: touching the profane way of mirth and
intemperance of this ungodly age. Afterward I visited my Lord Chief
Justice of Ireland, with whom I had long and private discourse
concerning the miserable condition that kingdom was like to be in, if
Tyrconnel's counsel should prevail at Court.

23d October, 1686. Went with the Countess of Sunderland to Cranbourne,
a lodge and walk of my Lord Godolphin's in Windsor park. There was one
room in the house spared in the pulling down the old one, because the
late Duchess of York was born in it; the rest was built and added to it
by Sir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy; and since, the whole was
purchased by my Lord Godolphin, who spoke to me to go see it, and advise
what trees were fit to be cut down to improve the dwelling, being
environed with old rotten pollards, which corrupt the air. It stands on
a knoll which though insensibly rising, gives it a prospect over the
Keep of Windsor, about three miles N. E. of it. The ground is clayey and
moist; the water stark naught; the park is pretty; the house tolerable,
and gardens convenient. After dinner, we came back to London, having two
coaches both going and coming, of six horses apiece, which we changed at
Hounslow.

24th October, 1686. Dr. Warren preached before the Princess at
Whitehall, on 5th Matthew, of the blessedness of the pure in heart, most
elegantly describing the bliss of the beatifical vision. In the
afternoon, Sir George Wheeler, knight and baronet, preached on the 4th
Matt. upon the necessity of repentance, at St. Margaret's, an honest and
devout discourse, and pretty tolerably performed. This gentleman coming
from his travels out of Greece, fell in love with the daughter of Sir
Thomas Higgins, his Majesty's resident at Venice, niece to the Earl of
Bath, and married her. When they returned into England, being honored
with knighthood, he would needs turn preacher, and took orders. He
published a learned and ingenious book of his travels, and is a very
worthy person, a little formal and particular, but exceedingly devout.

27th October, 1686. There was a triumphant show of the Lord Mayor both
by land and water, with much solemnity, when yet his power has been so
much diminished, by the loss of the city's former charter.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1686. I went to St. Martin's in the morning, where Dr.
Birch preached very boldly against the Papists, from John xvi. 2. In the
afternoon I heard Dr. Tillotson in Lincoln's Inn chapel, on the same
text, but more cautiously.

16th November, 1686. I went with part of my family to pass the
melancholy winter in London at my son's house in Arundel Buildings.

5th December, 1686. I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager at Somerset House, where dined divers French
noblemen, driven out of their country by the persecution.

16th December, 1686. I carried the Countess of Sunderland to see the
rarities of one Mr. Charlton in the Middle Temple, who showed us such a
collection as I had never seen in all my travels abroad either of
private gentlemen, or princes. It consisted of miniatures, drawings,
shells, insects, medals, natural things, animals (of which divers, I
think 100, were kept in glasses of spirits of wine), minerals, precious
stones, vessels, curiosities in amber, crystal, agate, etc.; all being
very perfect and rare of their kind, especially his books of birds,
fish, flowers, and shells, drawn and miniatured to the life. He told us
that one book stood him in £300; it was painted by that excellent
workman, whom the late Gaston, Duke of Orleans, employed. This
gentleman's whole collection, gathered by himself, traveling over most
parts of Europe, is estimated at £8,000. He appeared to be a modest and
obliging person.[62]

    [Footnote 62: This collection was afterward purchased by Sir Hans
    Sloane, and now forms part o£ the British Museum.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th December, 1686. I went to hear the music of the Italians in the
new chapel, now first opened publicly at Whitehall for the Popish
Service. Nothing can be finer than the magnificent marble work and
architecture at the end, where are four statues, representing St. John,
St. Peter, St. Paul, and the Church, in white marble, the work of Mr.
Gibbons, with all the carving and pillars of exquisite art and great
cost. The altar piece is the Salutation; the volto in _fresco_, the
Assumption of the blessed Virgin, according to their tradition, with our
blessed Savior, and a world of figures painted by Verrio. The throne
where the King and Queen sit is very glorious, in a closet above, just
opposite to the altar. Here we saw the Bishop in his mitre and rich
copes, with six or seven Jesuits and others in rich copes, sumptuously
habited, often taking off and putting on the Bishop's mitre, who sat in
a chair with arms pontifically, was adored and censed by three Jesuits
in their copes; then he went to the altar and made divers cringes, then
censing the images and glorious tabernacle placed on the altar, and now
and then changing place: the crosier, which was of silver, was put into
his hand with a world of mysterious ceremony, the music playing, with
singing. I could not have believed I should ever have seen such things
in the King of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten
this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed the
blessing, which I hope he will in mercy and his good time restore to its
purity.

Little appearance of any winter as yet.

1st January, 1686-87. Mr. Wake preached at St. Martin's on 1 Tim. iii.
16, concerning the mystery of godliness. He wrote excellently, in answer
to the Bishop of Meaux.

3d January, 1687. A Seal to confirm a gift of £4,000 per annum for 99
years to the Lord Treasurer out of the Post Office, and £1,700 per annum
for ever out of Lord Grey's estate.

There was now another change of the great officers. The Treasury was put
into commission, two professed Papists among them, viz, Lords Bellasis
and Dover, joined with the old ones, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen Fox,
and Sir John Ernley.

17th January, 1687. Much expectation of several great men declaring
themselves Papists. Lord Tyrconnel gone to succeed the Lord-Lieutenant
[Clarendon] in Ireland, to the astonishment of all sober men, and to the
evident ruin of the Protestants in that kingdom, as well as of its great
improvement going on. Much discourse that all the White Staff officers
and others should be dismissed for adhering to their religion. Popish
Justices of the Peace established in all counties, of the meanest of the
people; Judges ignorant of the law, and perverting it--so furiously do
the Jesuits drive, and even compel Princes to violent courses, and
destruction of an excellent government both in Church and State. God of
his infinite mercy open our eyes, and turn our hearts, and establish his
truth with peace! The Lord Jesus defend his little flock, and preserve
this threatened church and nation!

24th January, 1687. I saw the Queen's new apartment at Whitehall, with
her new bed, the embroidery of which cost £3,000. The carving about the
chimney piece, by Gibbons, is incomparable.

30th January, 1687. I heard the famous eunuch, Cifaccio, sing in the new
Popish chapel this afternoon; it was indeed very rare, and with great
skill. He came over from Rome, esteemed one of the best voices in Italy.
Much crowding--little devotion.

27th February, 1687. Mr. Chetwin preached at Whitehall on Rom. i. 18, a
very quaint, neat discourse of Moral righteousness.

2d March, 1687. Came out a proclamation for universal liberty of
conscience in Scotland, and depensation from all tests and laws to the
contrary, as also capacitating Papists to be chosen into all offices of
trust. The mystery operates.

3d March, 1687. Dr. Meggott, Dean of Winchester, preached before the
Princess of Denmark, on Matt. xiv. 23. In the afternoon, I went out of
town to meet my Lord Clarendon, returning from Ireland.

10th March, 1687. His Majesty sent for the Commissioners of the Privy
Seal this morning into his bedchamber, and told us that though he had
thought fit to dispose of the Seal into a single hand, yet he would so
provide for us, as it should appear how well he accepted our faithful
and loyal service with many gracious expressions to this effect; upon
which we delivered the Seal into his hands. It was by all the world both
hoped and expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord Clarendon;
but they were astonished to see it given to Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a
zealous Roman Catholic. Indeed it was very hard, and looked very
unkindly, his Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my going
to visit him and long discoursing with him about the affairs of Ireland)
finding not the least failure of duty in him during his government of
that kingdom, so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the
stronger influence of the Papists, who now got all the preferments.

Most of the great officers, both in the Court and country, Lords and
others, were dismissed, as they would not promise his Majesty their
consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes against Popish
Recusants. To this end, most of the Parliament men were spoken to in his
Majesty's closet, and such as refused, if in any place of office or
trust, civil or military, were put out of their employments. This was a
time of great trial; but hardly one of them assented, which put the
Popish interest much backward. The English clergy everywhere preached
boldly against their superstition and errors, and were wonderfully
followed by the people. Not one considerable proselyte was made in all
this time. The party were exceedingly put to the worst by the preaching
and writing of the Protestants in many excellent treatises, evincing the
doctrine and discipline of the reformed religion, to the manifest
disadvantage of their adversaries. To this did not a little contribute
the sermon preached at Whitehall before the Princess of Denmark and a
great crowd of people, and at least thirty of the greatest nobility, by
Dr. Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on John viii. 46 (the Gospel of the
day), describing through his whole discourse the blasphemies, perfidy,
wresting of Scripture, preference of tradition before it, spirit of
persecution, superstition, legends, and fables of the Scribes and
Pharisees, so that all the auditory understood his meaning of a parallel
between them and the Romish priests, and their new Trent religion. He
exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word, and to persevere in
the Faith taught in the Church of England, whose doctrine for Catholic
and soundness he preferred to all the communities and churches of
Christians in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy, that
whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial emerge to the
confusion of her adversaries and the glory of God.

I went this evening to see the order of the boys and children at
Christ's Hospital. There were near 800 boys and girls so decently clad,
cleanly lodged, so wholesomely fed, so admirably taught, some the
mathematics, especially the forty of the late King's foundation, that I
was delighted to see the progress some little youths of thirteen or
fourteen years of age had made. I saw them at supper, visited their
dormitories, and much admired the order, economy, and excellent
government of this most charitable seminary. Some are taught for the
Universities, others designed for seamen, all for trades and callings.
The girls are instructed in all such work as becomes their sex and may
fit them for good wives, mistresses, and to be a blessing to their
generation. They sang a psalm before they sat down to supper in the
great Hall, to an organ which played all the time, with such cheerful
harmony, that it seemed to me a vision of angels. I came from the place
with infinite satisfaction, having never seen a more noble, pious, and
admirable charity. All these consisted of orphans only.[63] The
foundation was of that pious Prince King Edward VI., whose picture (held
to be an original of Holbein) is in the court where the Governors meet
to consult on the affairs of the Hospital, and his statue in white
marble stands in a niche of the wall below, as you go to the church,
which is a modern, noble, and ample fabric. This foundation has had, and
still has, many benefactors.

    [Footnote 63: This is by no means the case now.]

16th March, 1687. I saw a trial of those devilish, murdering, mischief
doing engines called bombs, shot out of the mortar piece on Blackheath.
The distance that they are cast, the destruction they make where they
fall, is prodigious.

20th March, 1687. The Bishop of Bath and Wells (Dr. Ken) preached at St.
Martin's to a crowd of people not to be expressed, nor the wonderful
eloquence of this admirable preacher; the text was Matt. xxvi. 36 to
verse 40, describing the bitterness of our Blessed Savior's agony, the
ardor of his love, the infinite obligations we have to imitate his
patience and resignation; the means by watching against temptations, and
over ourselves with fervent prayer to attain it, and the exceeding
reward in the end. Upon all which he made most pathetical discourses.
The Communion followed, at which I was participant. I afterward dined at
Dr. Tenison's with the Bishop and that young, most learned, pious, and
excellent preacher, Mr. Wake. In the afternoon, I went to hear Mr. Wake
at the newly built church of St. Anne, on Mark viii. 34, upon the
subject of taking up the cross, and strenuously behaving ourselves in
time of persecution, as this now threatened to be.

His Majesty again prorogued the Parliament, foreseeing it would not
remit the laws against Papists, by the extraordinary zeal and bravery of
its members, and the free renunciation of the great officers both in
Court and state, who would not be prevailed with for any temporal
concern.

25th March, 1687. GOOD FRIDAY. Dr. Tenison preached at St. Martin's on 1
Peter ii. 24. During the service, a man came into near the middle of the
church, with his sword drawn, with several others in that posture; in
this jealous time it put the congregation into great confusion, but it
appeared to be one who fled for sanctuary, being pursued by bailiffs.

8th April, 1687. I had a rehearing of my great cause at the Chancery in
Westminster Hall, having seven of the most learned Counsel, my adversary
five, among which were the Attorney General and late Solicitor Finch,
son to the Lord Chancellor Nottingham. The account was at last brought
to one article of the surcharge, and referred to a Master. The cause
lasted two hours and more.

10th April, 1687. In the last week there was issued a Dispensation from
all obligations and tests, by which Dissenters and Papists especially
had public liberty of exercising their several ways of worship, without
incurring the penalty of the many Laws and Acts of Parliament to the
contrary. This was purely obtained by the Papists, thinking thereby to
ruin the Church of England, being now the only church which so admirably
and strenuously opposed their superstition. There was a wonderful
concourse of people at the Dissenters' meeting house in this parish, and
the parish church [Deptford] left exceedingly thin. What this will end
in, God Almighty only knows; but it looks like confusion, which I pray
God avert.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th April, 1687. To London about my suit, some terms of accommodation
being proposed.

19th April, 1687. I heard the famous singer, Cifaccio, esteemed the best
in Europe. Indeed, his holding out and delicateness in extending and
loosing a note with incomparable softness and sweetness, was admirable;
for the rest I found him a mere wanton, effeminate child, very coy, and
proudly conceited, to my apprehension. He touched the harpsichord to his
voice rarely well. This was before a select number of particular persons
whom Mr. Pepys invited to his house; and this was obtained by particular
favor and much difficulty, the Signor much disdaining to show his talent
to any but princes.

24th April, 1687. At Greenwich, at the conclusion of the Church service,
there was a French sermon preached after the use of the English Liturgy
translated into French, to a congregation of about 100 French refugees,
of whom Monsieur Ruvigny was the chief, and had obtained the use of the
church, after the parish service was ended. The preacher pathetically
exhorted to patience, constancy, and reliance on God amidst all their
sufferings, and the infinite rewards to come.

2d May, 1687. I dined with Mynheer Diskvelts, the Holland Ambassador, a
prudent and worthy person. There dined Lord Middleton, principal
Secretary of State, Lord Pembroke, Lord Lumley, Lord Preston, Colonel
Fitzpatrick, and Sir John Chardin. After dinner, the Ambassador
discoursed of and deplored the stupid folly of our politics, in
suffering the French to take Luxemburg, it being a place of the most
concern to have been defended, for the interest not only of the
Netherlands, but of England.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th May, 1687. To London. Lord Sunderland being Lord President and
Secretary of State, was made Knight of the Garter and Prime favorite.
This day there was such a storm of wind as had seldom happened, being a
sort of hurricane. It kept the flood out of the Thames, so that people
went on foot over several places above bridge. Also an earthquake in
several places in England about the time of the storm.

26th May, 1687. To London, about my agreement with Mr. Pretyman, after
my tedious suit.

2d June, 1687. I went to London, it having pleased his Majesty to grant
me a Privy Seal for £6,000, for discharge of the debt I had been so many
years persecuted for, it being indeed for money drawn over by my
father-in-law, Sir R. Browne, during his residence in the Court of
France, and so with a much greater sum due to Sir Richard from his
Majesty; and now this part of the arrear being paid, there remains yet
due to me, as executor of Sir Richard, above £6,500 more; but this
determining an expensive Chancery suit has been so great a mercy and
providence to me (through the kindness and friendship to me of Lord
Godolphin, one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,) that I do
acknowledge it with all imaginable thanks to my gracious God.

6th June, 1687. I visited my Lady Pierpoint, daughter to Sir John
Evelyn, of Deane [in Wilts], now widow of Mr. Pierpoint, and mother of
the Earl of Kingston. She was now engaged in the marriage of my cousin,
Evelyn Pierpoint, her second son.

There was about this time brought into the Downs a vast treasure, which
was sunk in a Spanish galleon about forty-five years ago, somewhere near
Hispaniola, or the Bahama islands, and was now weighed up by some
gentlemen, who were at the charge of divers, etc., to the enriching them
beyond all expectation. The Duke of Albemarle's share [Governor of
Jamaica] came to, I believe, £50,000. Some private gentlemen who
adventured £100, gained from £8,000 to £10,000. His Majesty's tenth was
£10,000.

The Camp was now again pitched at Hounslow, the Commanders profusely
vying in the expense and magnificence of tents.

12th June, 1687. Our Vicar preached on 2 Peter ii. 21, upon the danger
of relapsing into sin. After this, I went and heard M. Lamot, an
eloquent French preacher at Greenwich, on Prov. xxx. 8, 9, a consolatory
discourse to the poor and religious refugees who escaped out of France
in the cruel persecution.

16th June, 1687. I went to Hampton Court to give his Majesty thanks for
his late gracious favor, though it was but granting what was due. While
I was in the Council Chamber, came in some persons, at the head of whom
was a formal man with a large roll of parchment in his hand, being an
ADDRESS (as he said, for he introduced it with a speech) of the people
of Coventry, giving his Majesty their great acknowledgments for his
granting a liberty of conscience; he added that this was not the
application of one party only, but the unanimous address of Church of
England men, Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptists, to show how
extensive his Majesty's grace was, as taking in all parties to his
indulgence and protection, which had removed all dissensions and
animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds of Christian
charity, but exceedingly encourage their future industry, to the
improvement of trade, and spreading his Majesty's glory throughout the
world; and that now he had given to God his empire, God would establish
his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission; and so he gave
the roll to the King, which being returned to him again, his Majesty
caused him to read. The address was short, but much to the substance of
the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said
that what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was
ever his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them
in their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor to
settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.
After this, he gave them his hand to kiss. It was reported the
subscribers were above 1,000.

But this is not so remarkable as an address of the week before (as I was
assured by one present), of some of the FAMILY OF LOVE, His Majesty
asked them what this worship consisted in, and how many their party
might consist of; they told him their custom was to read the Scripture,
and then to preach; but did not give any further account, only said that
for the rest they were a sort of refined Quakers, but their number very
small, not consisting, as they said, of above threescore in all, and
those chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.

18th June, 1687. I dined at Mr. Blathwaite's (two miles from Hampton).
This gentleman is Secretary of War, Clerk of the Council, etc., having
raised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances. He is a
very proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and besides
all this, has married a great fortune. His income by the Army, Council,
and Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, brings him in
above £2,000 per annum.

23d June, 1687. The Privy Seal for £6,000 was passed to me, so that this
tedious affair was dispatched. Hitherto, a very windy and tempestuous
summer. The French sermons to the refugees were continued at Greenwich
Church.

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1687. I went to Wotton. In the way, I dined at Ashted, with
my Lady Mordaunt.

5th August, 1687. I went to see Albury, now purchased by Mr. Finch (the
King's Solicitor and son to the late Lord Chancellor); I found the
garden which I first designed for the Duke of Norfolk, nothing improved.

15th August, 1687. I went to visit Lord Clarendon at Swallowfield, where
was my Lord Cornbury just arrived from Denmark, whither he had
accompanied the Prince of Denmark two months before, and now come back.
The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he related to us;
the King keeps them under an army of 40,000 men, all Germans, he not
daring to trust his own subjects. Notwithstanding this, the Danes are
exceedingly proud, the country very poor and miserable.

22d August, 1687. Returned home to Sayes Court from Wotton, having been
five weeks absent with my brother and friends, who entertained us very
nobly. God be praised for his goodness, and this refreshment after my
many troubles, and let his mercy and providence ever preserve me. Amen.

3d September, 1687. The Lord Mayor sent me an Officer with a staff, to
be one of the Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital.

PERSECUTION RAGING IN FRANCE; divers churches there fired by lightning,
priests struck, consecrated hosts, etc., burnt and destroyed, both at
St. Malos and Paris, at the grand procession on Corpus Christi day.

13th September, 1687. I went to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop.
After dinner, I retired into the library, which I found exceedingly
improved; there are also divers rare manuscripts in a room apart.

6th October, 1687. I was godfather to Sir John Chardin's son, christened
at Greenwich Church, named John. The Earl of Bath and Countess of
Carlisle, the other sponsors.

29th October, 1687. An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a
mechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor. The King and Queen, and Dadi, the
Pope's Nuncio, invited to a feast at Guildhall. A strange turn of
affairs, that those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers of
Popery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome, one who
represented the very person of their Antichrist!

10th December, 1687. My son was returned out of Devon, where he had been
on a commission from the Lords of the Treasury about a concealment of
land.

20th December, 1687. I went with my Lord Chief-Justice Herbert, to see
his house at Walton-on-Thames: it is a barren place. To a very ordinary
house he had built a very handsome library, designing more building to
it than the place deserves, in my opinion. He desired my advice about
laying out his gardens, etc. The next day, we went to Weybridge, to see
some pictures of the Duchess of Norfolk's, particularly the statue, or
child in gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons to
think it rather a copy, from some proportion in the figures ill taken.
It was now exposed to sale.

12th January, 1687-88. Mr. Slingsby, Master of the Mint, being under
very deplorable circumstances on account of his creditors, and
especially the King, I did my endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to
be favorable to him.

My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton, being now married to
Lady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord
President of the Council, I and my family had most glorious favors sent
us, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary splendor.

15th January, 1688. There was a solemn and particular office used at
our, and all the churches of London and ten miles round, for a
thanksgiving to God, for her Majesty being with child.

22d January, 1688. This afternoon I went not to church, being employed
on a religious treatise I had undertaken.

_Post annum 1588--1660--1688, Annus Mirabilis Tertius._[64]

    [Footnote 64: This seems to have been added after the page was
    written.]

30th January, 1688. Being the Martyrdom day of King Charles I., our
curate made a florid oration against the murder of that excellent
Prince, with an exhortation to obedience from the example of David; 1
Samuel xxvi. 6.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1688. My daughter Evelyn going in the coach to visit in
the city, a jolt (the door being not fast shut) flung her quite out in
such manner, as the hind wheels passed over her a little above her
knees. Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels, she had no
other harm. In two days she was able to walk, and soon after perfectly
well; through God Almighty's great mercy to an excellent wife and a most
dutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.

17th February, 1688. I received the sad news of my niece Montague's
death at Woodcot on the 15th.

15th March, 1688. I gave in my account about the sick and wounded, in
order to have my quietus.

23d March, 1688. Dr. Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately published
his extravagant treatise about transubstantiation, and for abrogating
the test and penal laws, died. He was esteemed a violent, passionate,
haughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the Church of Rome, he
utterly refused it. A remarkable end!

The French TYRANT now finding he could make no proselytes among those
Protestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in
dungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so
long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom,
but utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great
numbers came daily into England and other places, where they were
received and relieved with very considerate Christian charity. This
Providence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out,
did so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to avoid the
persecution, signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went
to mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in
their conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great
numbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and
lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to
return to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but
peaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but
so without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebellion or
sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly,
meeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers
and priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever
they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced
death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their
persecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former
assembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible
constancy, that through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this
lapse. Such examples of Christian behavior have not been seen since the
primitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in
the end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on
his Providence.

24th March, 1688. I went with Sir Charles Littleton to Sheen, a house
and estate given him by Lord Brounker; one who was ever noted for a
hard, covetous, vicious man; but for his worldly craft and skill in
gaming few exceeded him. Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land,
house, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of
relation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of
Colchester, forty years before. It is a pretty place, with fine gardens,
and well planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles being an
honest gentleman and soldier. He is brother to Sir Henry Littleton of
Worcestershire, whose great estate he is likely to inherit, his brother
being without children. They are descendants of the great lawyer of that
name, and give the same arms and motto. He is married to one Mrs.
Temple, formerly maid of honor to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and
he has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune.

After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's near to it; the
most remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the
wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better
than I ever noted.

There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke's, in both these
houses, and some few statues and small busts in the latter.

From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel's, whose orangery and
_myrtetum_ are most beautiful and perfectly well kept. He was contriving
very high palisadoes of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,
and painting those reeds in oil.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st April, 1688. In the morning, the first sermon was by Dr.
Stillingfleet, Dean of St. Paul's (at Whitehall), on Luke x. 41, 42. The
Holy Communion followed, but was so interrupted by the rude breaking in
of multitudes zealous to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office could
hardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed without great
trouble. The Princess being come, he preached on Mich. vii. 8, 9, 10,
describing the calamity of the Reformed Church of Judah under the
Babylonian persecution, for her sins, and God's delivery of her on her
repentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now Reformed Church,
whenever insulted and persecuted. He preached with his accustomed
action, zeal, and energy, so that people flocked from all quarters to
hear him.

15th April, 1688. A dry, cold, backward spring; easterly winds.

The persecution still raging in France, multitudes of Protestants, and
many very considerable and great persons flying hither, produced a
second general contribution, the Papists, by God's Providence, as yet
making small progress among us.

29th April, 1688. The weather was, till now, so cold and sharp, by an
almost perpetual east wind, which had continued many months, that there
was little appearance of any spring, and yet the winter was very
favorable as to frost and snow.

2d May, 1688. To London, about my petition for allowances upon the
account of Commissioner for Sick and Wounded in the former war with
Holland.

8th May, 1688. His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet of the Dutch
(while we had a very inconsiderable one), went down to Chatham; their
fleet was well prepared, and out, before we were in any readiness, or
had any considerable number to have encountered them, had there been
occasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while being in profound
peace, there was a mighty land army, which there was no need of, and no
force at sea, where only was the apprehension; but the army was
doubtless kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance
Popery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by many instances
pursued by the Jesuits, against his first resolution to alter nothing in
the Church Establishment, so that it appeared there can be no reliance
on Popish promises.

18th May, 1688. The King enjoining the ministers to read his
Declaration for giving liberty of conscience (as it was styled) in all
churches of England, this evening, six Bishops, Bath and Wells,[65]
Peterborough,[66] Ely,[67] Chichester,[68] St. Asaph,[69] and
Bristol,[70] in the name of all the rest of the Bishops, came to his
Majesty to petition him, that he would not impose the reading of it to
the several congregations within their dioceses; not that they were
averse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness toward
dissenters, in relation to whom they should be willing to come to such a
temper as should be thought fit, when that matter might be considered
and settled in Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration
being founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside
all laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared to them illegal, as it
had done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of
such consequence, that they could not so far make themselves parties to
it, as the reading of it in church in time of divine service amounted
to.

    [Footnote 65: Thomas Ken.]

    [Footnote 66: Thomas White.]

    [Footnote 67: Francis Turner.]

    [Footnote 68: John Lake.]

    [Footnote 69: William Lloyd.]

    [Footnote 70: Sir John Trelawny, Bart.]

The King was so far incensed at this address, that he with threatening
expressions commanded them to obey him in reading it at their perils,
and so dismissed them.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th May, 1688. I went to Whitehall Chapel, where, after the morning
lessons, the Declaration was read by one of the choir who used to read
the chapters. I hear it was in the Abbey Church, Westminster, but almost
universally forborne throughout all London: the consequences of which a
little time will show.

25th May, 1688. All the discourse now was about the Bishops refusing to
read the injunction for the abolition of the Test, etc. It seems the
injunction came so crudely from the Secretary's office, that it was
neither sealed nor signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so
as the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the Court to great
difficulties how to proceed against them. Great were the consults, and a
proclamation was expected all this day; but nothing was done. The action
of the Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many adverse
parties, Papists only excepted, who were now exceedingly perplexed, and
violent courses were every moment expected. Report was, that the
Protestant secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.

The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into Portugal, now on the
sudden, on allegation of a great debt owing her by his Majesty disabling
her, declares her resolution to stay.

News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that was almost ever
heard of, subverting the city of Lima and country in Peru, with a
dreadful inundation following it.

8th June, 1688. This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the
Bishops of Ely, Chichester, St. Asaph, Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath
and Wells, were sent from the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for
refusing to give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the
Declaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give bail, as it
would have prejudiced their peerage. The concern of the people for them
was wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their blessing,
and praying for them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower
wharf.

10th June, 1688. A YOUNG PRINCE born, which will cause disputes.

About two o'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged, and the bells
ring for the birth of a Prince of Wales. This was very surprising, it
having been universally given out that her Majesty did not look till the
next month.

13th June, 1688. I went to the Tower to see the Bishops, visited the
Archbishop and the Bishops of Ely, St. Asaph, and Bath and Wells.

14th June, 1688. Dined with the Lord Chancellor.

15th June, 1688. Being the first day of term, the Bishops were brought
to Westminster on habeas corpus, when the indictment was read, and they
were called on to plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was
illegal; but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded. The
Court then offered to take bail for their appearance; but this they
refused, and at last were dismissed on their own recognizances to appear
that day fortnight; the Archbishop in £200, the Bishops in £100 each.

17 June, 1688. Was a day of thanksgiving in London and ten miles about
for the young Prince's birth; a form of prayer made for the purpose by
the Bishop of Rochester.

29th June, 1688. They appeared; the trial lasted from nine in the
morning to past six in the evening, when the jury retired to consider of
their verdict, and the Court adjourned to nine the next morning. The
jury were locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an
acquittal; but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent. At length he
agreed with the others. The Chief Justice, Wright, behaved with great
moderation and civility to the Bishops. Alibone, a Papist, was strongly
against them; but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,
they were acquitted. When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and
there was a lane of people from the King's Bench to the water side, on
their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.
Bonfires were made that night, and bells rung, which was taken very ill
at Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty Earls and Lords, etc., on
the bench, did not a little comfort them; but indeed they were all along
full of comfort and cheerful.

Note, they denied to pay the Lieutenant of the Tower (Hales, who used
them very surlily), any fees, alleging that none were due.

The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks, etc.

2d July, 1688. The two judges, Holloway and Powell, were displaced.

3d July, 1688. I went with Dr. Godolphin and his brother Sir William to
St. Alban's, to see a library he would have bought of the widow of Dr.
Cartwright, late Archdeacon of St. Alban's, a very good collection of
books, especially in divinity; he was to give £300 for them. Having seen
the GREAT CHURCH, now newly repaired by a public contribution, we
returned home.

8th July, 1688. One of the King's chaplains preached before the Princess
on Exodus xiv. 13, "Stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord,"
which he applied so boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of
England, that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders. The
Popish priests were not able to carry their cause against their learned
adversaries, who confounded them both by their disputes and writings.

12th July, 1688. The camp now began at Hounslow, but the nation was in
high discontent.

Colonel Titus, Sir Henry Vane (son of him who was executed for his
treason), and some other of the Presbyterians and Independent party,
were sworn of the Privy Council, from hopes of thereby diverting that
party from going over to the Bishops and Church of England, which now
they began to do, foreseeing the design of the Papists to descend and
take in their most hateful of heretics (as they at other times expressed
them to be) to effect their own ends, now evident; the utter extirpation
of the Church of England first, and then the rest would follow.

17th July, 1688. This night the fireworks were played off, that had been
prepared for the Queen's upsitting. We saw them to great advantage; they
were very fine, and cost some thousands of pounds, in the pyramids,
statues, etc., but were spent too soon for so long a preparation.

26th July, 1688. I went to Lambeth to visit the Archbishop, whom I
found very cheerful.

10th August, 1688. Dr. Tenison now told me there would suddenly be some
great thing discovered. This was the Prince of Orange intending to come
over.

15th August, 1688. I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire, seventy
miles. A coach and four horses took up me and my son at Whitehall, and
carried us to Dunstable, where we arrived and dined at noon, and from
thence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe, four miles
beyond Northampton, where we arrived by seven o'clock that evening. Both
these coaches were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,
who invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she entertained me and my
son with very extraordinary kindness; I stayed till the Thursday.

18th August, 1688. Dr. Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe, who was my
Lord's chaplain when ambassador in France, preached the shortest
discourse I ever heard; but what was defective in the amplitude of his
sermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least £600 a year in
spiritual advancement) had newly built, and made fit for a person of
quality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according
therewith.

My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a very strong, large
house, built with stone, not altogether modern. They were enlarging the
garden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening
into the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers
painted with blue and gilded. There is a noble walk of elms toward the
front of the house by the bowling green. I was not in any room of the
house besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new
Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom I had known from a child)
entertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly
married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace,
and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to
Althorpe, twelve miles distant.

[Sidenote: ALTHORPE]

The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in
form of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustered and _à la
moderne_; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state,
galleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince. It
is situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept, and
all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and
walks of trees, canals and fish ponds, and stored with game. And, what
is above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of
solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and
without, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is
any in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact
order, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble. The
meanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the
several tables, the good order and decency--in a word, the entire
economy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person. She is one who
for her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I
must ever honor and celebrate. I wish from my soul the Lord, her husband
(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous), was as worthy of
her, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself
unworthy! This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much
affliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of. The
Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable lady, has the
comfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy,
especially Mr. Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very
learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth.
Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord
Spencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonors both his name and his
family, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all
imaginable care of his education. There is a daughter very young married
to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland,
but who yet gives no great presage of worth,--so universally
contaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age! But this is
again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who
has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable
accomplishments and virtue.

23d August, 1688. I left this noble place and conversation, my lady
having provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we
went, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival.
Northampton, having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become a
town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and
townhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself.

Dr. Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter
to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any
longer among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the
Clergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in
prejudice of the Church of England.

The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea and land, which
with no small progress Popery makes among us, puts us to many
difficulties. The Popish Irish soldiers commit many murders and insults;
the whole nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.

After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little Prince of Wales
by hand (so many of her Majesty's children having died infants) not
succeeding, a country nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give
it suck.

18th September, 1688. I went to London, where I found the Court in the
utmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange's landing; which
put Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it
possible to find such a change.

Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back
the good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the
Church of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the
people, who showed their high discontent at several things in the
Government.

Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other
places in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of
greater calamities. God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put
themselves under the shadow of his wings, till these things be
overpassed.

30th September, 1688. The Court in so extraordinary a consternation, on
assurance of the Prince of Orange's intention to land, that the writs
sent forth for a Parliament were recalled.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th October, 1688. Dr. Tenison preached at St. Martin's on 2 Tim. iii.
16, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its
perfection above all traditions. After which, near 1,000 devout persons
partook of the Communion. The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit,
who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture
and railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they
pulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch
that it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.

Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion heightened to that
degree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the
dispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all
laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford. In
the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued
to remove Protestants and put in Papists at Portsmouth and other places
of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal
discontent. It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed
passionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom
they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying
incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of
his expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent. To such a
strange temper, and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation
reduced, and of which I was an eyewitness. The apprehension was (and
with reason) that his Majesty's forces would neither at land nor sea
oppose them with that vigor requisite to repel invaders.

The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and
the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by
their usual tricks. A letter was sent to the Archbishop of
Canterbury,[71] informing him, from good hands, of what was contriving
by them. A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was published.
The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form of prayer against the feared
invasion. A pardon published. Soldiers and mariners daily pressed.

    [Footnote 71: By Evelyn himself. The letter was as follows:--

    "My Lord, The honor and reputation which your Grace's piety,
    prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not
    only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally
    from those Protestants among us who are Dissenters from her
    discipline; God Almighty's Providence and blessing upon your Grace's
    vigilancy and extraordinary endeavors will not suffer to be
    diminished in this conjuncture. The conversation I now and then have
    with some in place who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing
    in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church's adversaries,
    obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the
    rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been
    required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion among
    well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have
    no cause to apprehend. The plan of this and of all that which is to
    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who
    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all
    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them. They have,
    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should
    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest
    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally
    about the town. I do not at all question but your Grace will
    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will
    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined
    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is
    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say
    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which
    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of
    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or
    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW
    ESTABLISHED, which Church the Papists tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,
    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is
    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so
    established, is but by an usurped authority. The antiquity of THAT
    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and
    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,
    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words
    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND
    BY LAW ESTABLISHED. And whosoever threatens to invade or come
    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they
    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them. My
    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I
    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all
    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does
    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove
    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your
    blessing. Lond., 10 Oct., 1688." (From a copy in Evelyn's
    handwriting.) See _post_, p. 285.]

14th October, 1688. The King's birthday. No guns from the Tower as
usual. The sun eclipsed at its rising. This day signal for the victory
of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex. The
wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day. Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet. Public prayers ordered to be read in the
churches against invasion.

28th October, 1688. A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a
Popish chapel that had been set up in the city.

29th October, 1688. Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty's
taking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the
Queen to intercede for him. It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some
reported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret
betrayed, which time may discover.

There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc. The Queen Dowager, and all
the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor, were
to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth,
recorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two
after. This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to
condescend to, on the talk of the people. It was remarkable that on this
occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and
Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among Papists, and their
bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred _præmunire_;--at least, if what I heard
be true.

30th October, 1688. I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,
in the place of the Earl of Sunderland.

Visited Mr. Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of
Burlington. The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,
and her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.

31st October, 1688. My birthday, being the 68th year of my age. O
blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!
Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from
those dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to
this sinful nation! Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,
disposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if
it be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which
hitherto thou hast continued to us! Amen, Amen!

1st November, 1688. Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir
Stephen Fox's. Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no
certainty. Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but
without any assurance. A man was taken with divers papers and printed
manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet
Council. There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction
of all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French. There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords
both spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of
the causes of his enterprise. This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what
was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some
public writing of this disloyal charge.

2d November, 1688. It was now certainly reported by some who saw the
fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on
Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take
leave of her husband.

4th November, 1688. Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere
about Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would
have been northward. The Court in great hurry.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1688. I went to London; heard the news of the Prince
having landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing
through the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them. This put the King and Court into great
consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their
further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways
very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.

The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and
Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth
their abhorrence of this invasion. They assured his Majesty that they
had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy
to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,
as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty
would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult
what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to
publish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the
Prince's manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the
Lords, spiritual and temporal. This did not please the King; so they
departed.

A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the
Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his
expedition, as there had been one before from the States.

These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it
by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us. This, in all
likelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we
cannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side. I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of
his people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and
Warner officiating.

14th November, 1688. The Prince increases everyday in force. Several
Lords go in to him. Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to
Honiton, the Prince's headquarters. The city of London in disorder; the
rabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the Papists of Lord
Berkeley, at St. John's. The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for
safety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful
aspect.

18th November, 1688. It was now a very hard frost. The King goes to
Salisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London. Lord Delamere
appears for the Prince in Cheshire. The nobility meet in Yorkshire. The
Archbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in
London, address his Majesty to call a Parliament. The King invites all
foreign nations to come over. The French take all the Palatinate, and
alarm the Germans more than ever.

29th November, 1688. I went to the Royal Society. We adjourned the
election of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public
commotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.

2d December, 1688. Dr. Tenison preached at St. Martin's on Psalm xxxvi.
5, 6, 7, concerning Providence. I received the blessed Sacrament.
Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of
Halifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;
he told me they had little power. Plymouth declared for the Prince.
Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of
quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,
and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations
against the Papists. The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,
fly or abscond. Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public
print, and is cried about the streets. Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford. The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to
Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor. Address from the Fleet not
grateful to his Majesty. The Papists in offices lay down their
commissions, and fly. Universal consternation among them; it looks like
a revolution.

7th December, 1688. My son went toward Oxford. I returned home.

9th December, 1688. Lord Sunderland meditates flight. The rabble
demolished all Popish chapels, and several Papist lords and gentlemen's
houses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,
and burned his library.

13th December, 1688. The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for
ballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.

The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to
St. James's, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General
of the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained
prisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his
Majesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be
quartered about the palace and city. This is taken heinously and the
King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on
the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I
was present).

17th December, 1688. That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to
assent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1688. I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve
o'clock--a sad sight! The Prince comes to St. James's, and fills
Whitehall with Dutch guards. A Council of Peers meet about an expedient
to call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords. The Chancellor,
Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken. The Earl of Sunderland
flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.

All the world go to see the Prince at St. James's, where there is a
great Court. There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came
over with him. He is very stately, serious and reserved. The English
soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.

24th December, 1688. The King passes into France, whither the Queen and
child were gone a few days before.

26th December, 1688. The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the
Parliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II. meeting, desire the
Prince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till
a convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by
his circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January. I had
now quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.

30th December, 1688. This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first
left off in our Church.

7th January, 1688-89. A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost
frozen over.

15th January, 1689. I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I
found the Bishops of St. Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and
Chichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,
Lord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.
After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,
concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find
there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and
Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen
without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory
party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon
conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder. The Romanists were busy among these several
parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other
interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions. I found nothing
of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me
into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve
their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name,
by that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being. Such was the result of this meeting.

My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent
him in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,
and that it came very seasonably.

I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were
indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in
that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this
conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that
kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with
the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at
present settled.

It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took
my leave, most of the Lords being gone.

The trial of the bishops was now printed.

The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the
question about the government, resolved that King James having by the
advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the
laws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away
the seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,
had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did
therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the
Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of
Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever
all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th January, 1689. I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a
child not twelve years old, the son of one Dr. Clench, of the most
prodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether
memory, but something more extraordinary. Mr. Pepys and myself examined
him, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required
judgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently. There was
not anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of
astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the
spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,
boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any
other part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and
demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he
would describe. He was able not only to repeat the most famous things
which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,
republics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred
stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the
monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower
Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of
the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.
Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms. We leaped from that
to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable
meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of
the Digest and Code. He gave a stupendous account of both natural and
moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.

Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or
angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in
knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard
of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the
Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms
without any contest. After a little thought, he told us that he knew of
nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to
meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little
conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was
received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world. He was perfect in the Latin
authors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,
Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient
Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further. He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who
had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going
about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a
lively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,
without the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.

His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by
causing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but
his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in
Latin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every
day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study. He was
perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek. In sum
(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of
anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who
has more knowledge than most men in the world. I counseled his father
not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

    "_Immodicis brevis est ætas, et rara senectus,_"

as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,
many years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in
shape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.

29th January, 1689. The votes of the House of Commons being carried up
by Mr. Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the
Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much
of the debate, which lasted very long. Lord Derby was in the chair (for
the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after
all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three
voices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority
alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and
expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down
particularly. Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:
others that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers. There were not more than eight or nine
bishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,
on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the
bishops being cast out of the House. In short, things tended to
dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the
Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and
others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they
made their court. The English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.
Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland. Nothing was yet done
toward a settlement. God of his infinite mercy compose these things,
that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober
establishment!

30th January, 1689. The anniversary of King Charles I.'s MARTYRDOM; but
in all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany
for the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated. Dr. Sharp preached
before the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.

31st January, 1689. At our church (the next day being appointed a
thanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers
purposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very
honest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances
of our Church, without touching on politics.

6th February, 1689. The King's coronation day was ordered not to be
observed, as hitherto it had been.

The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and
Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland
(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being
to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to
be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in
both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of
such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of
such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that
failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit. These
produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented
heads of such new laws as were to be enacted. It is thought on these
conditions they will be proclaimed.

There was much contest about the King's abdication, and whether he had
vacated the government. The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,
and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.

The Princess hourly expected. Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom
being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations
from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading
Flanders, and encountering the German Princes. It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in
many years.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st February, 1689. Dr. Burnet preached at St. James's on the
obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of
the nation and church.

I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her
coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation
and general good reception. Bonfires, bells, guns, etc. It was believed
that both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)
reluctance at least, of assuming her father's crown, and made some
apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement
necessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would
have shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character
given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's first declaration,
that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the
nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall
laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.
She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,
before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the
convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the
late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as
the Queen, her predecessor used to do. She smiled upon and talked to
everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since
her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see
her, and that she went to our prayers. This carriage was censured by
many. She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to
heart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is
wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike
gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France
calling for his care.

Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden
assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some
conditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting
to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part
of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a
crown was tempting. This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all
preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been
given him. My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the
same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have
well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it
had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,
acquiescing in due time.

The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of
conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests
and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so
much as appeared out of Lambeth. This occasioned the wonder of many who
observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and
all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the
absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and
especially the Papists.

Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention
only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves
on the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head. The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,
the government requiring a speedy settlement.

Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;
most of the old ones were turned out. Two or three white staves were
disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of
Devonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet
none in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as
Privy Seal. A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not
yet finished.

8th March, 1689. Dr. Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent
discourse on Matt. v. 44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of
enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about
impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while wise men
were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted,
an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men
in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did
not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the
absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of
the Prince of Wales was an imposture; five of the Bishops also still
refusing to take the new oath.

In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax was remitted
forever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes
on land, is not named.

The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and
officers for an expedition to Ireland. The great neglect in not more
timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland,
give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great offices among
themselves. The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission
of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give
success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten
the nation than could be expected. In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in
providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in
raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any
service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an
idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage, and many
disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th March, 1689. The new King much blamed for neglecting Ireland, now
likely to be ruined by the Lord Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too
strong for the Protestants. Wonderful uncertainty where King James was,
whether in France or Ireland. The Scots seem as yet to favor King
William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing
positively. Soldiers in England discontented. Parliament preparing the
coronation oath. Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the vote for
preserving the Protestant religion as established by law, without
mentioning what they were to have as to indulgence.

The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops refusing to come to
Parliament, it was deliberated whether they should incur _Præmunire_;
but it was thought fit to let this fall, and be connived at, for fear of
the people, to whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.

Court offices distributed among Parliament men. No considerable fleet as
yet sent forth. Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of
the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's
unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.

The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate, which they had
most barbarously ruined.

11th April, 1689. I saw the procession to and from the Abbey Church of
Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster Hall, at the coronation
of King William and Queen Mary. What was different from former
coronations, was some alteration in the coronation oath. Dr. Burnet, now
made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause. The Parliament men
had scaffolds and places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.
When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and
other services by tenure were performed. The Parliament men were feasted
in the Exchequer chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them,
worth five-and-forty shillings. On the one side were the effigies of the
King and Queen inclining one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter
throwing a bolt at Phäeton the words, "_Ne totus absumatur_": which was
but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as
apposite. The sculpture was very mean.

Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by the absence of
divers who should have contributed to it, there being but five Bishops,
four Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great
ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent. The next day the
House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the
Banqueting House.

12th April, 1689. I went with the Bishop of St. Asaph to visit my Lord
of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at
the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by
the Archbishop of York. We had much private and free discourse with his
Grace concerning several things relating to the Church, there being now
a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons. I
urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the
Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing in private
houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent
burials in churches; the one proceeding much from the pride of women,
bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent
danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of
the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of
ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of
permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings,
and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptizing in
chambers. To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavor to
get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.

We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might
cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save
such as were in new office, without any retrospect to such as either had
no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some
scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the
government as established by law. This we all knew to be the case of my
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so
fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King
James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.

King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d'Estrades,
whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the
Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit,
telling him that the King of France, his master, would never assist him
if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor
Prince is managed by the French.

Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of
their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his
right by maladministration; they proceeded with much more caution and
prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach
of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty, ill-principled
men. The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly
undermining all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish
so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and
profit.

21st April, 1689. This was one of the most seasonable springs, free from
the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year 1660 (the
year of the Restoration), which was much such an one.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1689. I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ
of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of
perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway,
etc., who were his judges. I then went with the Bishop of St. Asaph to
the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning
the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the third
trumpet and vial were now pouring out. My Lord St. Asaph considered the
killing of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the
Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, who by all appearance from good
history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till
now. The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident
that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful
people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them
in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc. xi.,
that they should both be slain together. They both much approved of Mr.
Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too
hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.
They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French
minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present
state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly anyone
travels.

There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in
Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of
that kingdom, to the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and which they
might so easily have done. This is a terrible beginning of more
troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people
being generally disaffected here and everywhere else, so that the seamen
and landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.

A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience
to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of
allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the bishops and others of the
clergy will not take. The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment. This is thought to have been driven on by the
Presbyterians, our new governors. God in mercy send us help, and direct
the counsels to his glory and good of his Church!

Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissensions among
ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing
unskillful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and
ability appearing,--threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.

A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently setting on
them in a creek as they were landing men in Ireland, by which we came
off with great slaughter and little honor--so strangely negligent and
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet. The Scots
Commissioners offer the crown to the NEW KING AND QUEEN on
conditions.--Act of Poll-money came forth, sparing none.--Now appeared
the Act of Indulgence for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving in office
according to law, with several other clauses.--A most splendid embassy
from Holland to congratulate the King and Queen on their accession to
the crown.

4th June, 1689. A solemn fast for success of the fleet, etc.

6th June, 1689. I dined with the Bishop of Asaph; Monsieur Capellus, the
learned son of the most learned Ludovicus, presented to him his father's
works, not published till now.

7th June, 1689. I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, and stayed with
him till about seven o'clock. He read to me the Pope's excommunication
of the French King.

9th June, 1689. Visited Dr. Burnet, now Bishop of Sarum; got him to let
Mr. Kneller draw his picture.

16th June, 1689. King James's declaration was now dispersed, offering
pardon to all, if on his landing, or within twenty days after, they
should return to their obedience.

Our fleet not yet at sea, through some prodigious sloth, and men minding
only their present interest; the French riding masters at sea, taking
many great prizes to our wonderful reproach. No certain news from
Ireland; various reports of Scotland; discontents at home. The King of
Denmark at last joins with the Confederates, and the two Northern Powers
are reconciled. The East India Company likely to be dissolved by
Parliament for many arbitrary actions. Oates acquitted of perjury, to
all honest men's admiration.

20th June, 1689. News of A PLOT discovered, on which divers were sent to
the Tower and secured.

23d June, 1689. An extraordinary drought, to the threatening of great
wants as to the fruits of the earth.

8th July, 1689. I sat for my picture to Mr. Kneller, for Mr. Pepys,
late Secretary to the Admiralty, holding my "Sylva" in my right hand. It
was on his long and earnest request, and is placed in his library.
Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner.

11th July, 1689. I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's
wedding day, when about three in the afternoon there was an unusual and
violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were
overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the
waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees
and ruining some houses. The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy
miles from London. It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did
much mischief.

16th July, 1689. I went to Hampton Court about business, the Council
being there. A great apartment and spacious garden with fountains was
beginning in the park at the head of the canal.

19th July, 1689. The Marshal de Schomberg went now as General toward
Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry. Our fleet lay before Brest. The
Confederates passing the Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a
passage into France. A great victory gotten by the Muscovites, taking
and burning Perecop. A new rebel against the Turks threatens the
destruction of that tyranny. All Europe in arms against France, and
hardly to be found in history so universal a face of war.

The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting, exempt the
Duke of Hanover from the succession to the crown, which they seem to
confine to the present new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark,
who is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her being
thought with child may prove a TYMPANY only, so that the unhappy family
of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing; and then what government is
likely to be next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election, or
otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters from the Church of England
evidently looking that way.

The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy there. Great discontents
through this nation at the slow proceedings of the King, and the
incompetent instruments and officers he advances to the greatest and
most necessary charges.

23d August, 1689. Came to visit me Mr. Firmin.

25th August, 1689. Hitherto it has been a most seasonable summer.
Londonderry relieved after a brave and wonderful holding out.

21st September, 1689. I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury since
his suspension, and was received with great kindness. A dreadful fire
happened in Southwark.

2d October, 1689. Came to visit us the Marquis de Ruvignè, and one
Monsieur le Coque, a French refugee, who left great riches for his
religion; a very learned, civil person; he married the sister of the
Duchess de la Force. Ottobone, a Venetian Cardinal, eighty years old,
made Pope.[72]

    [Footnote 72: Peter Otthobonus succeeded Innocent XI. as Pope in
    1689, by the title of Alexander VIII.]

31st October, 1689. My birthday, being now sixty-nine years old. Blessed
Father, who hast prolonged my years to this great age, and given me to
see so great and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them to
this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance of my prayers and
thankful acknowledgments, and grant me grace to be working out my
salvation and redeeming the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me
here, and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call for it, to
perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that heavenly kingdom where
there are no more changes or vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy,
and consummate felicity, forever. Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the
sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior. Amen!

5th November, 1689. The Bishop of St. Asaph, Lord Almoner, preached
before the King and Queen, the whole discourse being an historical
narrative of the Church of England's several deliverances, especially
that of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday of the
Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the 4th), and his landing
at Torbay this day. There was a splendid ball and other rejoicings.

10th November, 1689. After a very wet season, the winter came on
severely.

17th November, 1689. Much wet, without frost, yet the wind north and
easterly. A Convocation of the Clergy meet about a reformation of our
Liturgy, Canons, etc., obstructed by others of the clergy.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1689. I went to London with my family, to winter at Soho,
in the great square.

11th January, 1689-90. This night there was a most extraordinary storm
of wind, accompanied with snow and sharp weather; it did great harm in
many places, blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people. It
began about two in the morning, and lasted till five, being a kind of
hurricane, which mariners observe have begun of late years to come
northward. This winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.

12th January, 1690. There was read at St. Ann's Church an exhortatory
letter to the clergy of London from the Bishop, together with a Brief
for relieving the distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to the Protestant Cantons
of Switzerland.

The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of April to the
discontent and surprise of many members who, being exceedingly averse to
the settling of anything, proceeding with animosities, multiplying
exceptions against those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves, as there
was before against King James. The new King resolved on an expedition
into Ireland in person. About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near St. Dunstan's,
sent some of their company to the King, to assure him of their service;
he returned his thanks, advising them to repair to their several
counties and preserve the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending the Laws and
Religion established. The great Lord suspected to have counselled this
prorogation, universally denied it. However, it was believed the chief
adviser was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be most in
favor.

2d February, 1690. The Parliament was dissolved by proclamation, and
another called to meet the 20th of March. This was a second surprise to
the former members; and now the Court party, or, as they call
themselves, Church of England, are making their interests in the
country. The Marquis of Halifax lays down his office of Privy Seal, and
pretends to retire.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th February, 1690. The Duchess of Monmouth's chaplain preached at St.
Martin's an excellent discourse exhorting to peace and sanctity, it
being now the time of very great division and dissension in the nation;
first, among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober part were for
a speedy reformation of divers things, which it was thought might be
made in our Liturgy, for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff
and rigid, were for no condescension at all. Books and pamphlets were
published every day pro and con; the Convocation were forced for the
present to suspend any further progress. There was fierce and great
carousing about being elected in the new Parliament. The King persists
in his intention of going in person for Ireland, whither the French are
sending supplies to King James, and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.

19th February, 1690. I dined with the Marquis of Carmarthen (late Lord
Danby), where was Lieutenant-General Douglas, a very considerate and
sober commander, going for Ireland. He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for want of clothes
and necessaries this winter, exceedingly magnifying their courage and
bravery during all their hardships. There dined also Lord Lucas,
Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Bishop of St. Asaph. The Privy Seal was
again put in commission, Mr. Cheny (who married my kinswoman, Mrs.
Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney. The
imprudence of both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that the King had lately
directed a letter to the Bishops to order their clergy to preach against
that sin, swearing, etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in
execution without any indulgence.

25th February, 1690. I went to Kensington, which King William had bought
of Lord Nottingham, and altered, but was yet a patched building, but
with the garden, however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.

7th March, 1690. I dined with Mr. Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had
been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane. Among other
discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed
by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding
advantage we of this nation had by being the first who built frigates,
the first of which ever built was that vessel which was afterward called
"The Constant Warwick," and was the work of Pett of Chatham, for a trial
of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks,
the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing,
that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended,
taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that
more such being built, did in a year or two scour the Channel from those
of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it. He added that
it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the
sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of
building huge great ships and second and third rates, they would leave
off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify
gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations,
and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons
were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being
capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and
inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those
so otherwise useful swift frigates. These being to encounter the
greatest ships would be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those
who should manage the fire ships, and the Prince who should first store
himself with numbers of such fire ships, would, through the help and
countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such
vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those
light, swift ships to guard the fire ships. He concluded there would
shortly be no other method of seafight; and that great ships and
men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who
should encounter them with far less number. He represented to us the
dreadful effect of these fire ships; that he continually observed in our
late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire ship
approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such
consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of
the guns, bombs, etc., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and
astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about,
forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every one looking about to
see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be
drowned if they did so. This he said was likely to prove hereafter the
method of seafight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they
continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on
account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th March, 1690. Preached at Whitehall Dr. Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum,
on Heb. iv. 13, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and
that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very
small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made
this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was
done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as
action. This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we
ought to live and behave ourselves before such an all-seeing Deity; and
how we were to conceive of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the
nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and
therefore it was that in Scripture we attribute those actions and
affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any
proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance
of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, "God will
remember the sins of the penitent no more:" not as if God could forget
anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.

I dined at the Bishop of St. Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with
the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland),
against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books,
but now most friendly reconciled.[73] He related to us many particulars
of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the inveterate hatred
which the Presbyterians show to the family of the Stuarts, and the
exceeding tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on earth,
in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the
right of government; their implacable hatred to the Episcopal Order and
Church of England. He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents from
our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the 20 of
Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among them feigning himself a
Protestant, and who was the first who began to pray extempore, and
brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of,
praying by the Spirit. This Jesuit remained many years before he was
discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he was buried at ...
having yet on his monument, "_Rosa inter spinas_."

    [Footnote 73: Sir George, as we have seen, had written in praise of
    a Private Life, which Mr. Evelyn answered by a book in praise of
    Public Life and Active Employment.]

11th March, 1690. I went again to see Mr. Charlton's curiosities, both
of art and nature, and his full and rare collection of medals, which
taken altogether, in all kinds, is doubtless one of the most perfect
assemblages of rarities that can be any where seen. I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed, large, and
intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was wonderful to consider.
The French have landed in Ireland.

16th March, 1690. A public fast.

24th May, 1690. City charter restored. Divers exempted from pardon.

4th June, 1690. King William set forth on his Irish expedition, leaving
the Queen Regent.

10th June, 1690. Mr. Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, showing with
what malice and injustice he was suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about
the timber, of which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of
Parliament, with the exceeding danger which the fleet would shortly be
in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed
the Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
state, and showed his great ability.

18th June, 1690. Fast day. Visited the Bishop of St. Asaph; his
conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near
destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up
to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased
God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in
their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and
Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into
the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures
with, and afterward declared for, them. He then invited these poor
people from their dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of
their religion, and begged pardon for the ill usage they had received,
charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it. These
being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of
St. Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses spoken of in the
Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was
looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should
persuade two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with £20 toward their journey, at that very
time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring
them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should
be returned safely to their country before they arrived. This happening
contrary to all expectation and appearance, did exceedingly credit the
Bishop's confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to
pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years
before.

I afterward went with him to Mr. Boyle and Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explained the necessity of it so fully, and so learnedly made
out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom
of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till thirty years, when
Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly
reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should
obtain through all the world. He showed how Mr. Brightman, Mr. Mede, and
other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning
the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present
calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St. John all
along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.

24th June, 1690. Dined with Mr. Pepys, who the next day was sent to the
Gatehouse,[74] and several great persons to the Tower, on suspicion of
being affected to King James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the
Queen's uncle. King William having vanquished King James in Ireland,
there was much public rejoicing. It seems the Irish in King James's army
would not stand, but the English-Irish and French made great resistance.
Schomberg was slain, and Dr. Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry. King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a
cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little
interruption of his pursuit. Hamilton, who broke his word about
Tyrconnel, was taken. It is reported that King James is gone back to
France. Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William be
returning, we may say of him as Cæsar said, "_Veni, vidi, vici_." But to
alloy much of this, the French fleet rides in our channel, ours not
daring to interpose, and the enemy threatening to land.

    [Footnote 74: Poor Pepys, as the reader knows, had already undergone
    an imprisonment, with perhaps just as much reason as the present, on
    the absurd accusation of having sent information to the French Court
    of the state of the English Navy.]

[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th June, 1690. I went to visit some friends in the Tower, when asking
for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake directed me to the Earl of
Torrington, who about three days before had been sent for from the
fleet, and put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the French
fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders, while
Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters of the sea, threatening a
descent.

20th July, 1690. This afternoon a camp of about 4,000 men was begun to
be formed on Blackheath.

30th July, 1690. I dined with Mr. Pepys, now suffered to return to his
house, on account of indisposition.

1st August, 1690. The Duke of Grafton came to visit me, going to his
ship at the mouth of the river, in his way to Ireland (where he was
slain).

3d August, 1690. The French landed some soldiers at Teignmouth, in
Devon, and burned some poor houses. The French fleet still hovering
about the western coast, and we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships
in the bay of Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under three
admirals. The country in the west all on their guard. A very
extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th was a very great storm of
thunder and lightning, and on the 15th the season much changed to wet
and cold. The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which were up
through England, were dismissed. The French King having news that King
William was slain, and his army defeated in Ireland, caused such a
triumph at Paris, and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in
the midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished, by a speedy
flight and escape, himself brought the news of his own defeat.

15th August, 1690. I was desired to be one of the bail of the Earl of
Clarendon, for his release from the Tower, with divers noblemen. The
Bishop of St. Asaph expounds his prophecies to me and Mr. Pepys, etc.
The troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth. That sweet and hopeful
youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds he received in the fight of
the Boyne, to the great sorrow of all his friends, being (I think) the
last male of that family, to which my wife is related. A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his age, having had the
advantage of the choicest breeding abroad, both as to arts and arms; he
had traveled much, but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his
unfortunate King.

The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening, the naval
expedition is hindered, and the extremity of wet causes the siege of
Limerick to be raised, King William returned to England. Lord Sidney
left Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near three parts
[in four].

17th August, 1690. A public feast. An extraordinary sharp, cold, east
wind.

12th October, 1690. The French General, with Tyrconnel and their
forces, gone back to France, beaten out by King William. Cork delivered
on discretion. The Duke of Grafton was there mortally wounded and dies.
Very great storms of wind. The 8th of this month Lord Spencer wrote me
word from Althorpe, that there happened an earthquake the day before in
the morning, which, though short, sensibly shook the house. The
"Gazette" acquainted us that the like happened at the same time,
half-past seven, at Barnstaple, Holyhead, and Dublin. We were not
sensible of it here.

26th October, 1690. Kinsale at last surrendered, meantime King James's
party burn all the houses they have in their power, and among them that
stately palace of Lord Ossory's, which lately cost, as reported,
£40,000. By a disastrous accident, a third-rate ship, the Breda, blew up
and destroyed all on board; in it were twenty-five prisoners of war. She
was to have sailed for England the next day.

3d November, 1690. Went to the Countess of Clancarty, to condole with
her concerning her debauched and dissolute son, who had done so much
mischief in Ireland, now taken and brought prisoner to the Tower.

16th November, 1690. Exceeding great storms, yet a warm season.

23d November, 1690. Carried Mr. Pepys's memorials to Lord Godolphin, now
resuming the commission of the Treasury, to the wonder of all his
friends.

1st December, 1690. Having been chosen President of the Royal Society, I
desired to decline it, and with great difficulty devolved the election
on Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.

20th December, 1690. Dr. Hough, President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who was displaced with several of the Fellows for not taking the oath
imposed by King James, now made a Bishop. Most of this month cold and
frost. One Johnson, a Knight, was executed at Tyburn for being an
accomplice with Campbell, brother to Lord Argyle, in stealing a young
heiress.

4th January, 1690-91. This week a PLOT was discovered for a general
rising against the new Government, for which (Henry) Lord Clarendon and
others were sent to the Tower. The next day, I went to see Lord
Clarendon. The Bishop of Ely searched for. Trial of Lord Preston, as not
being an English Peer, hastened at the Old Bailey.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th January, 1691. Lord Preston condemned about a design to bring in
King James by the French. Ashton executed. The Bishop of Ely, Mr.
Graham, etc., absconded.

13th March, 1691. I went to visit Monsieur Justell and the Library at
St. James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS. (which were in
good number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many
years. Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.

21st March, 1691. Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good
pictures. After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute. Sir
William had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much
expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat
at Easton, near Towcester.[75]

    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the
    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow
    of Thomas, the first Earl.]

25th March, 1691. Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a
letter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit
Lord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1691. This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all
the buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,
beginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had
been pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),
and consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both
King Charles II. and others, and were his destruction.

The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happened--Proclamation against the Papists, etc.

16th April, 1691. I went to see Dr. Sloane's curiosities, being an
universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting
of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and
insects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,
and one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of
grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc. This
collection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural
discourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,
sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.

    [Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British
    Museum.]

19th April, 1691. The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the
oaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.
Tillotson, Dean of St. Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from
Chichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.

22d April, 1691. I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.

24th April, 1691. I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now
come to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland. This is a
mystery. The King preparing to return to the army.

7th May, 1691. I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]
yet at Lambeth. I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,
especially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or
divine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr. Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his
advice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he
believed he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says
the Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "_Nolo_," and say it from the
heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be
done in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate. What he will do I
know not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead
their interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty
in their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as
wise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against
their consciences. I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said
that he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house
altogether disfurnished and his books packed up.

1st June, 1691. I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and
his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was
performed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the
afternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there. I was the
chief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard
Onslow, Mr. Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr. Hyldiard, Mr. James, Mr. Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew. He was laid in the
vault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family. A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th June, 1691. I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the
Tower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.

17th June, 1691. A fast.

11th July, 1691. I dined with Mr. Pepys, where was Dr. Cumberland, the
new Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr. Lloyd having been put out for not
acknowledging the Government. Cumberland is a very learned, excellent
man. Possession was now given to Dr. Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the
Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep
possession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was
dispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned. This stout demeanor of the
few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a
great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though
those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people
never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not
heretics. The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty
of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave
no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,
there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure
of that order in the Church. I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the
Tower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's
permission, under the care of his warden.

    [Footnote 77: A mistake. Dr. Cumberland was made Bishop of
    Peterborough and Dr. John Moore succeeded Dr. Lloyd in the see of
    Norwich.]

18th July, 1691. To London to hear Mr. Stringfellow preach his first
sermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to
which I did recommend him to Dr. Tenison for the constant preacher and
lecturer. This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by
King James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr. Tenison, rector of
St. Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious
man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the
Doctor. I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person. This
Church, though erected in St. Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he
was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood having become
so populous. Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister,
and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,

19th July, 1691. In the morning Dr. Tenison preached the first sermon,
taking his text from Psalm xxvi. 8. "Lord, I have loved the habitation
of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth." In concluding,
he gave that this should be made a parish church so soon as the
Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in honor of
the three undivided persons in the Deity; and he minded them to attend
to that faith of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us. In the afternoon, Mr. Stringfellow
preached on Luke vii. 5. "The centurion who had built a synagogue." He
proceeded to the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person of the generous
centurion, as was comprehensive of all the virtues of an accomplished
Christian, in a style so full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard
a sermon more apposite to the occasion. He modestly insinuated the
obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter
of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the
advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches,
hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful
books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so
exemplary for his benefaction to that place. Indeed, that excellent
person, Dr. Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library [in
St. Martin's]; and set up two or three free schools at his own charges.
Besides this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains in
constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself to promote the
service of God both in public and private. I never knew a man of a more
universal and generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.

The great victory of King William's army in Ireland was looked on as
decisive of that war. The French General, St. Ruth, who had been so
cruel to the poor Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the
best commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed, but of the
enemy 4,000 or 5,000.

26th July, 1691. An extraordinary hot season, yet refreshed by some
thundershowers.

28th July, 1691. I went to Wotton.

2d August, 1691. No sermon in the church in the afternoon, and the
curacy ill-served.

16th August, 1691. A sermon by the curate; an honest discourse, but read
without any spirit, or seeming concern; a great fault in the education
of young preachers. Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the
rain and wind very violent. Our fleet come in to lay up the great ships;
nothing done at sea, pretending that we cannot meet the French.

13th September, 1691. A great storm at sea; we lost the "Coronation" and
"Harwich," above 600 men perishing.

14th October, 1691. A most pleasing autumn. Our navy come in without
having performed anything, yet there has been great loss of ships by
negligence, and unskillful men governing the fleet and Navy board.

7th November, 1691. I visited the Earl of Dover, who having made his
peace with the King, was now come home. The relation he gave of the
strength of the French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was very wide from
what we fancied.

8th to 30th November, 1691. An extraordinary dry and warm season,
without frost, and like a new spring; such as had not been known for
many years. Part of the King's house at Kensington was burned.

6th December, 1691. Discourse of another PLOT, in which several great
persons were named, but believed to be a sham.--A proposal in the House
of Commons that every officer in the whole nation who received a salary
above £500 or otherwise by virtue of his office, should contribute it
wholly to the support of the war with France, and this upon their oath.

25th December, 1691. My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a
daughter.

26th December, 1691. An exceedingly dry and calm winter; no rain for
many past months.

28th December, 1691. Dined at Lambeth with the new Archbishop. Saw the
effect of my greenhouse furnace, set up by the Archbishop's son-in-law.

30th December, 1691. I again saw Mr. Charlton's collection of spiders,
birds, scorpions, and other serpents, etc.

1st January, 1691-92. This last week died that pious, admirable
Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy friend, Mr. Boyle, aged
about 65,--a great loss to all that knew him, and to the public.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th January, 1692. At the funeral of Mr. Boyle, at St. Martin's, Dr.
Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached on Eccles. ii. 26. He concluded
with an eulogy due to the deceased, who made God and religion the scope
of all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and who had
arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied with such zeal and
extraordinary piety, which he showed in the whole course of his life,
particularly in his exemplary charity on all occasions,--that he gave
£1,000 yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland; was at
the charge of translating the Scriptures into the Irish and Indian
tongues, and was now promoting a Turkish translation, as he had formerly
done of Grotius "on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries; that he had
settled a fund for preachers who should preach expressly against
Atheists, Libertines, Socinians, and Jews; that he had in his will given
£8,000 to charitable uses; but that his private charities were
extraordinary. He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek, his
reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology, once
deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and that at the time of
restoration of King Charles II., when he might have made a great figure
in the nation as to secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able
to discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline that, and
his humility the other. He spoke of his civility to strangers, the great
good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to
what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life he led, and
the happy end he made. Something was touched of his sister, the Lady
Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him. And truly all this was but
his due, without any grain of flattery.

This week a most execrable murder was committed on Dr. Clench, father of
that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed. Under
pretense of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him
in it; and, sending away the coachman under some pretense, they left his
dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.

12th January, 1692. My granddaughter was christened by Dr. Tenison, now
Bishop of Lincoln, in Trinity Church, being the first that was
christened there. She was named Jane.

24th January, 1692. A frosty and dry season continued; many persons die
of apoplexy, more than usual. Lord Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of
the King's army in England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive taking of
bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions from his inferior
officers. Note, this was the Lord who was entirely advanced by King
James, and was the first who betrayed and forsook his master. He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.

7th February, 1692. An extraordinary snow fell in most parts.

13th February, 1692. Mr. Boyle having made me one of the trustees for
his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting of the Bishop of Lincoln,
Sir Rob.... wood, and serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the
will which related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing and
electing a minister to preach one sermon the first Sunday in the month,
during the four summer months, expressly against Atheists, Deists,
Libertines, Jews, etc., without descending to any other controversy
whatever, for which £50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to a new election
of some other able divine, or to continue the same, as the trustees
should judge convenient. We made choice of one Mr. Bentley, chaplain to
the Bishop of Worcester (Dr. Stillingfleet). The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St. Martin's; the second
Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so alternately.

28th February, 1692. Lord Marlborough having used words against the
King, and been discharged from all his great places, his wife was
forbidden the Court, and the Princess of Denmark was desired by the
Queen to dismiss her from her service; but she refusing to do so, goes
away from Court to Sion house. Divers new Lords made: Sir Henry Capel,
Sir William Fermor, etc. Change of Commissioners in the Treasury. The
Parliament adjourned, not well satisfied with affairs. The business of
the East India Company, which they would have reformed, let fall. The
Duke of Norfolk does not succeed in his endeavor to be divorced.[78]

    [Footnote 78: See _post_ pp. 351-52.]

20th March, 1692. My son was made one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to which employment he had a mind, far
from my wishes. I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me the
picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of France, seeming in
my opinion very much to resemble the Queen his mother, and of a most
vivacious countenance.

April, 1692. No spring yet appearing. The Queen Dowager went out of
England toward Portugal, as pretended, against the advice of all her
friends.

4th April, 1692. Mr. Bentley preached Mr. Boyle's lecture at St.
Mary-le-Bow. So excellent a discourse against the Epicurean system is
not to be recapitulated in a few words. He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything in it which I
desired to be altered. I took this as a civility, and earnestly desired
it should be printed, as one of the most learned and convincing
discourses I had ever heard.

6th April, 1692. A fast. King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.

24th April, 1692. Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising. Our fleet begins to join with the Dutch. Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister. Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692. Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet. Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France. The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us. Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.

8th May, 1692. My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.

12th May, 1692. A fast.

13th May, 1692. I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.

15th May, 1692. My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland. After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.

29th May, 1692. Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.

9th June, 1692. I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland. We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away. An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.

23d July, 1692. I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained. The next day to St. George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.

25th July, 1692. To Mr. Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den. Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr. Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr. Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit. Mr. Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.
Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.

This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.

26th July, 1692. I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr. Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr. Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.

9th August, 1692. A fast. Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.

11th August, 1692. My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.

14th August, 1692. Still an exceedingly wet season.

15th September, 1692. There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe. It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret. I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.
The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.

1st October, 1692. This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable. No fruit ripened kindly. Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.

6th November, 1692. There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.

10th November, 1692. A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.

20th November, 1692. Dr. Lancaster, the new Vicar of St. Martin's,
preached.

A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London. They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses. They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.

14th December, 1692. With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr. Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr. Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself. We intended to take him in again the
next year.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93. Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried. The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly. The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.

4th February, 1693. After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable. 69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.

Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the negroes in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design. Hitherto an exceedingly mild
winter. France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land. Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place. Dr. Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.

    [Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii. 714, from the papers of the Rev.
    Mr. Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695. Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]

19th February, 1693. The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him. Proposals of a
marriage between Mr. Draper and my daughter Susanna. Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather. The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.

26th February, 1693. An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw. A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.

19th March, 1693. A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit. King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.

31st March, 1693. I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.

23d April, 1693. An extraordinary wet spring.

27th April, 1693. My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr. Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop). I gave her in portion £4,000, her jointure is £500
per annum. I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!
She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex. She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle. She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance. This
character is due to her, though coming from her father. Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.

11th May, 1693. We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.
There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!

14th May, 1693. Nothing yet of action from abroad. Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes. Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament. These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it. A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.

June, 1693. WHITSUNDAY. I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.

11th June, 1693. I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.

21st June, 1693. I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall. They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here. Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale. Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough. There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan. Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for £20. Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.

24th June, 1693. A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.

9th July, 1693. Mr. Tippin, successor of Dr. Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693. I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth £4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings. In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.

18th July, 1693. I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr. Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr. Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr. Daun for £250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.

1st August, 1693. Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr. Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.

6th August, 1693. Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.

31st October, 1693. A very wet and uncomfortable season.

12th November, 1693. Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office. The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.

14th November, 1693. In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr. Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, £3,000; my coachman £40.

17th November, 1693. Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age. I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.

30th November, 1693. Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it. Sir Robert Southwell was
continued. We all dined at Pontac's as usual.

3d December, 1693. Mr. Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square. I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr. Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself. We chose Mr. Bentley again. The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice. The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.

    [Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells. Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]

10th December, 1693. A very great storm of thunder and lightning.

1st January, 1693-94. Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted. Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.

11th January, 1694. Supped at Mr. Edward Sheldon's, where was Mr.
Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil. He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.

21st January, 1694. Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week. Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.

11th February, 1694. Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.

10th March, 1694. Mr. Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.

22d March, 1694. Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694. Mr. Goode, minister of St. Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.

30th March, 1694. I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity. The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act. He professed great kindness to our
family.

1st April, 1694. Dr. Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.

13th April, 1694. Mr. Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.

15th April, 1694. One Mr. Stanhope preached a most excellent sermon.

22d April, 1694. A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses. It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it. I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers. It lasted many months. "The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
£200,000. The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to £30, and the India to £80. Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined. One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.

A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above £200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly. The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel. He was taken and condemned
for murder. The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it. It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner. He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding. This was a subject of much discourse.

24th April, 1694. I went to visit Mr. Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest. His house is an academy of
itself. I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated. A public Bank of
£140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war. The whole month of April without rain. A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints. Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day. This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopædia Biblica." My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694. I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.

6th May, 1694. This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people. I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it. Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.

30th May, 1694. This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said. He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined. Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!

Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.
He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers. From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court. All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct. I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew. It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.

3d June, 1694. Mr. Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him. He had suffered much by a fire.
Seasonable showers.

14th June, 1694. The public fast. Mr. Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.

1st July, 1694. Mr. Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.

The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of £120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.
All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.
Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.

13th July, 1694. Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest. This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge. Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.

4th August, 1694. I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned. All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr. Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature. They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives. The boys were at school.

5th August, 1694. Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694. I went to St. Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part. Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal. As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach. The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious. I went also to see the
building beginning near St. Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr. Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.

28th October, 1694. Mr. Stringfellow preached at Trinity church.

22d November, 1694. Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out. A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died. The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr. Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of £1,000 per annum.

    [Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]

29th November, 1694. I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II. being poisoned. Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr. Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr. Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a Papist (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered. Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr. Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings. Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.

9th December, 1694. I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.
Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.

13th December, 1694. I went to London to congratulate him. He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr. Williams, to succeed Mr. Bentley in Mr.
Boyle's lectures.

29th December, 1694. The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal. The Queen died of it on the 28th.

13th January, 1694-95. The Thames was frozen over. The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week. The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her £5,000 a quarter.

20th January, 1695. The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.

February, 1695. Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr. Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.

3d February, 1695. The long frost intermitted, but not gone.

17th February, 1695. Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.

24th February, 1695. I saw the Queen lie in state.

27th February, 1695. The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster. This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was £50,000, against her desire.

5th March, 1695. I went to see the ceremony. Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth. There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.

8th March, 1695. I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable. She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die. This
paper was not found in time to be observed. There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person. In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.

10th March, 1695. I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.
My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St. James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.

The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me. Dr. Gale showed me a MS. of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St. Luke.

24th March, 1695. EASTER DAY. Mr. Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes. The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.
This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].

March, 1695. The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.

31st March, 1695. Mr. Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695. Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh. Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.

14th April, 1695. After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.

21st April, 1695. The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed. Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor. Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.

5th May, 1695. I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London. Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more. The Commission was read by Mr. Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.

17th May, 1695. Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.

21st May, 1695. We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr. Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.

24th May, 1695. We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for £6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design. My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.

31st May, 1695. Met again. Mr. Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.

7th June, 1695. The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.

14th May, 1695. Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.

5th July, 1695. At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about £7,000 or
£8,000.

6th July, 1695. I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer. After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor. We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.

11th July, 1695. Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.

14th July, 1695. No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s. for
marriages, burials, etc. A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695. I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished. Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton. At Wotton, Mr. Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.

28th July, 1695. A very wet season.

11th August, 1695. The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.

25th September, 1695. Mr. Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.
This was the first time I had heard him preach. Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French. The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather. My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near £70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man. The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.

29th September, 1695. Very cold weather. Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly. A great funeral at Addiscombe. His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir. There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc. appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending. The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace. The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed. I dined with Dr. Gale at
St. Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS. concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.

25th October, 1695. The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight. He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water. He had newly buried £200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity. He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo. Very mild
weather the whole of October.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695. Mr. Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall. He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.

13th November, 1695. Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress. He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained. These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.
James's great square, where the King stood.

17th November, 1695. I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St. James's library, where the
books want place.

21st November, 1695. I went to see Mr. Churchill's collection of
rarities.

23d November, 1695. To Lambeth, to get Mr. Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year. Among others who dined there was Dr. Covel, the
great Oriental traveler.

1st December, 1695. I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.

23d December, 1695. The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.

25th December, 1695. Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather. Now snow and
frost.

12th January, 1695-96. Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.

2d February, 1696. An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold. The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham. It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day. An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St. Paul's.

23d February, 1696. They now began to coin new money.

26th February, 1696. There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English Papists,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed. In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army. It was discovered
by some of their own party. £1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named. Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured. The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the Papists and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution. All Papists, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London. This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James. The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent. This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken. I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God. Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many o£ his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.

1st March, 1696. The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels. We
are yet upon them. This deliverance is due solely to God. French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.

8th March, 1696. Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.

Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples. Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent. Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.

    [Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.]

Great frost and cold.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696. I visited Mr. Graham in the Fleet.

10th April, 1696. The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied. I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684. See p.
    198.]

12th April, 1696. A very fine spring season.

19th April, 1696. Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn. One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster. This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.

21st April, 1696. We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.

23d April, 1696. I went to Eton, and dined with Dr. Godolphin, the
provost. The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson. I went to see the
King's House at Kensington. It is very noble, though not great. The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library. The gardens about it very delicious.

26th April, 1696. Dr. Sharp preached at the Temple. His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.

28th April, 1696. The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants. More executions this week of the assassins. Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.

2d May, 1696. I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr. Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr. Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of £50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.

6th May, 1696. I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies. We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.

13th May, 1696. I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed. Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities. The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _præmunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination. This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath. This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender. Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.

29th May, 1696. We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.

[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696. I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden. This was done soon after.

4th June, 1696. A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General. We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.

11th June, 1696. Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman. He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters. Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken. Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company. Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets. Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies. To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value. Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly £90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash. Banks and lotteries every day set up.

18th June, 1696. The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of £11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,£20,000 between them. The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.

20th June, 1696. I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr. Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.

21st June, 1696. An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.

25th June, 1696. A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr. Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills. This deed was proved to be forged. The
cause went on my lady's side. This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court. A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.

30th June, 1696. I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together. Mr. Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.

4th July, 1696. Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.

7th July, 1696. A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.

12th July, 1696. Very unseasonable and uncertain weather.

26th July, 1696. So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for £2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.

3d August, 1696. The Bank lending the £200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.
Reasonable good harvest weather. I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr. Thomas
Watson, Bishop of St. David's, who was suspended for simony. The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.

September, 1696. Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer. Scarcity in Scotland.

6th September, 1696. I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr. Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.
After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.

24th October, 1696. Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.

November, 1696. Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.

8th November, 1696. The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.
More plots talked of. Search for Jacobites so called.

15th-23d November, 1696. Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.

13th December, 1696. Continuance of extreme frost and snow.

17th January, 1696-7. The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow. Conspiracies continue against King William. Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.

7th February, 1697. Severe frost continued with snow. Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.

    (Here a leaf of the MS. is lost.)

17th August, 1697. I came to Wotton after three months' absence.

September, 1697. Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind. My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.

12th September, 1697. Mr. Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted]. Welcome tidings of the Peace.

3d October, 1697. So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697. The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.

2d December, 1697. Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall. The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron. ix. 7, 8. The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.

5th December, 1697. Was the first Sunday that St. Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.

6th December, 1697. I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King. The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came. This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power. I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey. When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.

12th December, 1697. At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.

18th December, 1697. At Lambeth, to Dr. Bentley, about the Library at
St. James's.

23d December, 1697. I returned to Wotton.

1697-98. A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company. I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.

2d January, 1698. Dr. Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698. Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.

30th January, 1698. The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.

The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house. Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.
    The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study. He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses. The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in. The King
    pays for all he has."]

21st April, 1698. The Czar went from my house to return home. An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.

8th May, 1698. An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits. Corn at nine shillings a bushel [£18 a load].

30th May, 1698. I dined at Mr. Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr. Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had. He sung several compositions of the late Dr.
Purcell.

5th June, 1698. Dr. White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St. Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St. Paul's. His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr. Turner of Ely, and Dr. Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St. Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.

8th June, 1698. I went to congratulate the marriage of Mr. Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.

9th June, 1698. To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court. I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr. London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed £150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury. I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.

6th August, 1698. I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations. He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons. He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with. He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.

    [Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain. His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]

25th September, 1698. Dr. Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift. I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.

7th December, 1698. Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr. Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge. Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.

18th December, 1698. Very warm, but exceedingly stormy.

January, 1698-99. My cousin Pierrepoint died. She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number. This displeased the
Court party. Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.

17th February, 1699. My grandson went to Oxford with Dr. Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.

19th February, 1699. A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.

5th March, 1699. The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.

The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.

24th March, 1699. My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family. He was aged
forty-four years and about three months. He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.

26th March, 1699. After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long. Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658). That year died
Cromwell.

30th March, 1699. My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.

The Duke of Devon lost £1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.

The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.
This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.

April, 1699. Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of ...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc." There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient. This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known. His tutor was one Florival of Geneva.

    [Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]

29th April, 1699. I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St. James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.

3d May, 1699. At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr. Edward Stillingfleet).

4th May, 1699. The Court party have little influence in this Session.

7th May, 1699. The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission. All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital. Mr.
Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it. He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man. I saw the library of Dr. John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.

    [Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely. He died 31st of July, 1714.
    King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    £6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]

11th June, 1699. After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower. The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses. Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe. She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said. She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits. She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699. This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St. James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _éclât_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense. He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of £7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.

19th June, 1699. My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.

25th June, 1699. The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.

28th June, 1699. Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.

23d July, 1699. Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.

August, 1699. I drank the Shooters' Hill waters. At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church. The Bishop of St. David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.

    [Footnote 88: _Ante_, p. 330.]

3d September, 1699. There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers. I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses. A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.

4th October, 1699. My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding. He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free. There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county. He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession. He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs. Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived. He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.
My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes. This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son. The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland. Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me. His
sister, Wych, had a portion of £6,000, to which was added £300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about £5,000 each. My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.
She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman. There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors. I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.

21st October, 1699. After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost. I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.

15th November, 1699. There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction. I was in it, and in danger. Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing. It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it. At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.

19th November, 1699. At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr. Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before. A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady. She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age. Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.

24th November, 1699. I signed Dr. Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.

Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper! A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.

3d December, 1699. Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April. So
continued on 21st of January. A great earthquake in Portugal.

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt. They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.

    [Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices. This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]

14th January, 1699-1700. Dr. Lancaster, Vicar of St. Martin's, dismissed
Mr. Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr. Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.
Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr. Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel. The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien." See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]

21st January, 1700. Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.

25th January, 1700. I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's. The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end. This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.

4th February, 1700. The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain. They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).

18th February, 1700. Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain. The Vicar of St. Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.

8th March, 1700. The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th. On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.

13th March, 1700. I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon. She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about £20,000. She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with £500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.

24th March, 1700. The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.
Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London. The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.

    [Footnote 91: _Ante_, p. 349.]

25th March, 1700. Dr. Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii. 5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy." He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.

April, 1700. The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, Papists indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father. The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.

The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably. That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission. The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.
However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance. This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland. Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far. Among the rest, there passed a law as to Papists' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir. This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the Papists here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.

24th April, 1700. This week there was a great change of State officers.
The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat. Mr. Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out. The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons. This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture. It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.
But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.

A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.

10th May, 1700. The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.
Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of £1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th. Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.

[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700. I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.

2d June, 1700. A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.

9th-16th June, 1700. In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.

July, 1700. I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.

The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.

13th July, 1700. I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it. The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen. He and his lady
received us with great civility. The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
£700 or £800.

20th September, 1700. I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation. The estate and park about it also in decay.

    [Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]

23d September, 1700. I went to visit Mr. Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities. The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.

31st October, 1700. My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age. I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!

5th November, 1700. Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr. Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort. We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.

17th November, 1700. Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court. Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.

30th November, 1700. At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.

8th December, 1700. Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose. Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole. The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.

January, 1700-01. I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.

4th January, 1701. An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.

19th January, 1701. Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.

9th February, 1701. The old Speaker laid aside, and Mr. Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen. Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.

27th February, 1701. By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.

Mr. Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man. I gave it to
Dr. Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.

18th March, 1701. I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds. 28th. I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state. Dr. Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p. 40.

April, 1701. A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character. How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born. It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy. Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.

4th April, 1701. The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr. Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer. Mr. How made a Baron.

May, 1701. Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county. There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701. They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less. They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited. Burnet gives an account of them.]

A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.

17th May, 1701. Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.
The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of
calling the assembly and dissolving. Atterbury and Dr. Wake writing one
against the other.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1701. The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.

22d June, 1701. I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness. He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.

July, 1701. My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary £500 per annum.

8th July, 1701. My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer. There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs. Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.

14th July, 1701. I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.

August, 1701. The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.

2d September, 1701. I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr. Wise, who was there to receive
me.

The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.

Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth £10,000 to the lawyers. His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear. He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire. It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices. He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.

29th September, 1701. I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week. My steward was Mr. Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor. I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr. Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.

31st October, 1701. I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.

December, 1701. Great contentions about elections. I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr. Weston.

27th December, 1701. My grandson quitted Oxford.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02. At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr. Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.

8th March, 1702. The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.

I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.

12th April, 1702. My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters. Our relation and friendship had been long and
great. He was a man of excellent parts. He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after. This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea. He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane. By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune. He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.

My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to £1,900.

3d May, 1702. The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction. Lord Godolphin made Lord High Treasurer.

Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed £10 per annum
toward the carrying it on. We agreed that every missioner, besides the
£20 to set him forth, should have £50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him £100 per annum. We
sent a young divine to New York.

22d June, 1702. I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr. Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.

27th June, 1702. I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty. Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party. The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.

31st October, 1702. Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me. I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age. I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements. My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul. Amen!

8th November, 1702. My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox. He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.

Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!
The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St. Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.

December, 1702. The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.

After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire £5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above £30,000 a year in places and employments, with £50,000 at
interest. He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater. He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.

January, 1702-03. News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future. The fourth died.

    [Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]

Sir Richard Onslow and Mr. Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo. O.)
fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House. Mr. Oglethorpe was disarmed. The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote. Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703. A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr. Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate. The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox. A great
earthquake at Rome, etc. A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her £500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices. She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above £1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.

26th May, 1703. This day died Mr. Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity. When King James II. went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity. He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation. His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially. Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.
Jackson, a young gentleman, whom Mr. Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir. Mr. Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr. Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.

13th June, 1703. Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.

11th July, 1703. I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished. I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.

25th July, 1703. The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.

12th August, 1703. The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer. From August 1696, there had been
expended in building £89,364 14s. 8d.

31st October, 1703. This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.

21st November, 1703. The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics. He made an excellent discourse on 1 Cor.
xv., v. 55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state. I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703. The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal. Many houses demolished, and people killed. As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age. I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.

7th December, 1703. I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.

31st December, 1703. I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.

January, 1703-04. The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment. After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.

    title of Charles VI.]

16th January, 1704. The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of £300 a year.

30th January, 1704. The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.

May, 1704. Dr. Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world. He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning. This is a serious
alarm to me. God grant that I may profit by it! He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb. He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr. Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.

    [Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.]

7th September, 1704. This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc. The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned. Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner. The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels. Music and
trumpets at every city company. The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St. Paul's, where the Dean preached. After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St. James's. The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night. Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.
The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.

    [Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]

October, 1704. The year has been very plentiful.

31st October, 1704. Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.

December, 1704. Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."

My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr. Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.

9th February, 1704. I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature. He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain. I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.

21st February, 1704. Remarkable fine weather. Agues and smallpox much in
every place.

11th March, 1704. An exceedingly dry season. Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant. A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton. The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age. She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.

May, 1704. The Bailiff of Westminster hanged himself. He had an ill
report.

On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.

18th May, 1704. I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.

20th May, 1704. Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members. I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr. Harvey, of Combe.

4th January, 1704-05. I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr. King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.

June, 1705. The season very dry and hot. I went to see Dr. Dickinson the
famous chemist. We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations. He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St. John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.

I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for. The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.

[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705. Mr. Cowper made Lord Keeper. Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless £2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice. His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got £100,000 and made
themselves Barons. A new Secretary of State. Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in. An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen. The Parliament chose one
Mr. Smith, Speaker. There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450. The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.

31st October, 1705. I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.
Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!

1st January, 1705-06. Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom. Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.
Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.

27th January, 1706. My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.

3d February, 1706. Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

    [Footnote 98: Mr. Evelyn died on the 27th of this month.]
